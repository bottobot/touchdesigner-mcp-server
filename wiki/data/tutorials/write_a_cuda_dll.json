It allows you to use all the tools TouchDesigner already has to create, load, manipulate, save and visualize data that you are passing to and sending out of your CUDA program. For example if you want to write a CUDA program that does something with audio data, instead of having to write your own code that loads audio using an external API, you can simply load the audio into a CHOP, and pass that data into the CUDA program.  Similarly instead of having to write your own OpenGL code to visualize the output of a CUDA program, it can be visualized using the tools TouchDesigner already has."
