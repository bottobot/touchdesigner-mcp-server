NotchLC tends to start dropping frames well before the harddrive bandwidth capacity is reached suggesting the limiting factor is more CPU limitations."

HAPQ is a constant bitrate codec that will generate the same file size independent of pixel content. The data is stored in a format that is immediately readable by the GPU so it uses very little CPU or GPU resource to decode.  HAPQ is an 8bit codec and compression quality is good but depending on the content, you will see artifacts like banding in soft gradients. NotchLC is a pseudo 10bit Codec so it holds more color information. The NotchLC optimal setting yeilds very high quality file that can be used as an intermediate format for further processing and editing in a traditional visual effects or video production pipeline. NotchLC compression is variable based on the pixel content. The more noisey the content the less it will compress and therefore will yield larger file sizes. A standard live action video file in HAPQ with no secondary compression is approximately 5% smaller than NotchLC. The same file in HAQ with secondary compression is approximately 15% smaller."
