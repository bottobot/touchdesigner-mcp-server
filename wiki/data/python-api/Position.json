  "description": "The position class holds a single 3 component position. A position is a single point in space, and it's important to use a position or vector as appropriate for the data that is being calculated, since matrix operations on them will end in different results. When being multiplied by a Matrix, this class will implicitly have a 4th component (W component) of 1. If the Matrix is a projection matrix that will cause the W component to become something other than 1, all 4 components will be divided by W to make the position homogeneous again. A new position can be created without any arguments, with 3 arguments for the x,y,z values, or with a single argument which is a variable that has 3 entries such as a list of length 3, or another position or vector.",
