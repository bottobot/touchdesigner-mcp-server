  "description": "The vector class holds a single 3 component vector. A vector describes a direction in space, and it's important to use a vector or Position as appropriate for the data that is being calculated. When being multiplied by a Matrix, this class will implicitly have a 4th component (W component) of 0. A new vector can be created without any arguments, with 3 arguments for the x,y,z values, or with a single argument which is a variable that has 3 entries such as a list of length 3, or a position or vector.\nExamples of creating a vector:",
