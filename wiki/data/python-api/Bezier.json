  "description": "A Bezier describes an instance of a single geometry Bezier primitive (containing a set of connected Bezier curves). It is an instance of a Prim Class.\nIt can be created from either a Model SOP or Script SOP.\nEach curve is described by a set of segments, where each segment is a list of vertices. The first and last vertex of each segment is an anchor position, while its neighboring vertices describe tangent handles.",
