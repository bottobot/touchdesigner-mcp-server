  "description": "The MOD class provides access to Module On Demand object, which allows DATs to be dynamically imported as modules.  It can be accessed with the mod object, found in the automatically imported td module.  Alternatively, one can use the regular python statement: import.\nUse of the import statement is limited to modules in the search path, where as the mod format allows complete statements in one line, which is more useful for entering expressions.  Also note that DAT modules cannot be organized into packages as regular file system based python modules can be.",
