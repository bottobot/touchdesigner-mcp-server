One process will contain a Sync Out CHOP while one or more other processes contain Sync In CHOPs. The processes with Sync In CHOPs should have their Realtime flag checked off, as their frame rates will be determined by the Sync Out CHOP.  Also note, all monitors (including all clients and server) should be set to the same rate.  Note that unplugging or re-adding monitors may sometime change previously configured settings.\n\nThe CHOPs synchronize by pausing their own timeline until all Sync In/Out CHOPs have cooked. The Sync Out CHOP will be ahead of the Sync In CHOPs. If any CHOPs fail to communicate, the others will timeout, causing all processes to run slowly. \nClient machines may come online at any point, or be switched off as desired, as the Sync Out CHOP will adjust accordingly, either timing out, temporarily or permanently banning individual clients as specified.\nIn addition any extra  channels sent through the Sync Out CHOP is received by the Sync In CHOPs. \nNOTE for Windows OS - If experiencing connection issues make sure Windows Firewall is disabled.\nAn Info DAT, pointing to the Sync Out CHOP, provides a detailed list of all clients:\t\t\nThe columns are:\t\t\n\npid: process id of the client\naddress: ip and port number\nmachine_name: client machine name\nfilename: name of the  file the client resides in\nop_path: full operator path to the client\ninclude:  when 1, the Sync Out CHOPs waits for a reply, when 0, it is ignored.\ntimeout_total:  The total number of times the Sync Out  stalled waiting for this client\ntimeout_consecutive:  The running number of times the Sync Out  stalled waiting for this client.\nsteady_total: The total number of times the Sync Out  received a reply in time.\nsteady_consecutive: The running number of times the Sync Out  received a reply in time:\nreply:  The last reply from the client, all clients should have the same increasing value.Similarly, an Info CHOP will reveal further information: Info CHOP Channels\t\n\n\nWhenever a client replies, it is immediately assumed reliable, and waited upon, by the Sync Out CHOP each frame thereafter.\t\t\nWhen a client times-out a number of times in a row, however, it is continuously ignored by the Sync Out CHOP, until it replies on time again. \t\t\nThis also applies to clients that have stopped communicating altogether.\t\t\nThe number of consecutive timeouts is controlled by the Client Timeouts (consecutive) parameter and is reflected by the timeout_consecutive Info DAT column.\t\t\n\n\nIf a particular client is dropping frames, inspect the Sync Out  on the server side with an info .  Look at the column for timeout_consecutive. As well take note of the info chop channel for the sync in  called sync_incompletes.  If one or both of these attributes are increasing, try adjusting the TimeOut parameter on the sync .  Increasing this value has been known to remedy this issue.\n\n\nIf a client produces unreliable communication, sometimes steady, sometimes timing out, then it can be permanently ignored by enabling Ban Clients and setting the Total Timeouts accordingly.  Once a client timeouts a certain number of times, its Info  include column reports banned and it will always be ignored, even if it starts responding in time again.\t\t\n\n\nWhenever the Sync Out  first starts any and all clients are accepted, and nothing is banned.  Pressing Clear Stats in the Sync Out CHOP also returns to this state, clearing all banned lists, and totals, even in the remote client Info CHOPs.\t\t\n\t\t\nSee also Syncing Multiple Computers and Hardware Frame Lock.\nsyncinCHOP_Class\n\nContents\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n  active - Whether or not the  is currently attempting to synchronize itself to a Sync Out CHOP.\n\n\n\t\n  multicastaddress - An IP address to communicate on (224.0.0.1).\n\n\n\t\n  port - The network port associated with the address.\n\n\n\t\n  timeout - The maximum amount of time the  will wait for synchronization signals from the other Sync CHOPs.

Increasing this value has been known to remedy this issue.\n\n\nIf a client produces unreliable communication, sometimes steady, sometimes timing out, then it can be permanently ignored by enabling Ban Clients and setting the Total Timeouts accordingly.  Once a client timeouts a certain number of times, its Info  include column reports banned and it will always be ignored, even if it starts responding in time again.\t\t\n\n\nWhenever the Sync Out  first starts any and all clients are accepted, and nothing is banned.  Pressing Clear Stats in the Sync Out CHOP also returns to this state, clearing all banned lists, and totals, even in the remote client Info CHOPs.\t\t\n\t\t\nSee also Syncing Multiple Computers and Hardware Frame Lock.\nsyncinCHOP_Class\n\nContents\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n  active - Whether or not the  is currently attempting to synchronize itself to a Sync Out CHOP.\n\n\n\t\n  multicastaddress - An IP address to communicate on (224.0.0.1).\n\n\n\t\n  port - The network port associated with the address.\n\n\n\t\n  timeout - The maximum amount of time the  will wait for synchronization signals from the other Sync CHOPs.

Multi-line text is often a python Script or GLSL Shader, but can be any multi-line text. Tables are rows and columns of cells, each containing a text string.\n\n\n\nA Time Slice is the time from the last cook frame to the current cook frame. In CHOPs it is the set of short channels that contain the CHOP channels' samples between the last and the current cook frame.\n\n\n\nA parameter in most CHOPs that restricts which channels of that CHOP will be affected. Normally all channels of a CHOP are affected by the operator. TOPs have Channel Mask, a similar feature.\n\n\n\nsamples-per-second of a CHOP. Each CHOP in your network has a sample rate. In contrast, the overall timeline has a Frame Rate, which is the number of frames to cook and display per second, generally your monitor display frequency, default 60.\n\n\n\nExporting is the connection of CHOP channels to parameters of operators. The output of each exporting CHOP is one or more channels, active only while the CHOP Viewer is on. The current value of a channel can be exported to a parameter of any operator, overriding that parameter's value. See Parameter.\n\n\n\nThe location of an operator within the TouchDesigner environment, for example, /geo1/circle1, a node called circle1 in a component called geo1. The path / is called Root. This path is displayed at the top of every Pane, showing which Component's network you are currently in. To refer instead to a filesystem folder, directory, disk file or http: address, see Folder.\n\n\n\nEvery operator in TouchDesigner has a set of control Parameters that can be integer or floating point numbers, menus, binary toggles, text strings or operator paths, which determine the output of the operator.\n\n\n\nTouchDesigner is a hierarchy of components. \"root\" is the top-most network in the hierarchy. The Network Path or Path for root is simply /. A typical path is /project1/moviein1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Sync_In_CHOP&oldid=24549\"",
