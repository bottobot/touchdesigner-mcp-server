The result is stored in a 1x1, 1xN or Nx1 image depending on the chosen scope (See  parameter below). The calculated values can be brought into CHOPs using the TOP to CHOP node.\nNote: When using the minimum and maximum operators, the default behaviour is to select the pixel with the highest value as chosen in the Analyze Channel parameter. For example, if Luminance is selected, the output will be the RGBA values of the pixel with the highest luminance, not the luminance value itself. Similarly, if a single channel is selected e.g. Red, Green, Blue, etc, then the output will be the pixel with the highest red value, rather than the highest values in each channel. To find the min or max values in each channel separately, set the Analyze Channel to RGBA Independent.\nNote: When the operation is set to Count Pixels or Sum, the output image will default to a 32 bit floating point format in order to properly store the output data. For all other operations, the default output format will match the input format. The image format can be set manually using the parameter on the Common page.\nNote: Using the Exclude NaNs or Mask features will slow down the performance of the node and should only be enabled if they are necessary.\nanalyzeTOP_Class\n\nContents\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n  op -  - The operation to perform on the input image.\n\n average - Find the average value in each channel of the input image. This operation is notably slower when the Exclude NaNs or Mask features are used as the node must perform two passes to calculate the results. minimum - Find the pixel with the lowest value as determined by the 'Analyze ' parameter. See Notes in the summary for more details. maximum - Find the pixel with the highest value as determined by the 'Analyze ' parameter. See Notes in the summary for more details. count - Calculates the number of valid pixels in the input image. By default, the output will be fixed based on the dimensions of the image as determined by the '' parameter e.g. Full Image = width*height. When Exclude NaNs is enabled or a Mask is defined, the output will be the number of pixels that pass the mask and NaN checks. By default, when counting pixels the output image will be set to a 32bit floating point format. sum - Calculates the sum of all pixels in the input image by adding all of the values together. By default, the output image will be set to a 32bit floating point format in order to correctly store the output result. minrgb - Find the minimum value from the red, green and blue channels. All channels of the output will contain the same minimum value. minrgba - Find the minimum value from the red, green, blue and alpha channels. All channels of the output will contain the same minimum value. maxrgb - Find the maximum value from the red, green and blue channels. All channels of the output will contain the same maximum value. maxrgba - Find the maximum value from the red, green, blue and alpha channels. All channels of the output will contain the same maximum value.\n\n  analyzechannel -  - Determines what value the operation is being performed on. For example, when the operation is Minimum and the Analyze Channel is Red, the output will be the pixel with the lowest red value (not necessarily the lowest Blue or Green values). To separately find the lowest value in each channel, set this parameter to RGBA Independent.\n\n luminance - The output results are based on the luminance of the input pixels. Luminance is the relative intensity of the pixel based on the values in the RGB channels. Note: the output contains the original RGBA values of the pixel with the highest/lowest luminance, not the luminance value itself. red - Calculations are based only on the value in the red channel. green - Calculations are based only on the value in the green channel. blue - Calculations are based only on the value in the blue channel. alpha - Calculations are based only on the value in the alpha channel. rgbaverage - Calculations are based on the average value of the RGB channels. average - Calculations are based on the average value of the RGBA channels. independent - Calculations are performed on each channels separately. Use this mode if you want to find the highest/lowest values in each channel. rgbmax - max -\n\n  scope -  - Determines how pixels are grouped together to calculate the results.\n\n image - Calculations are performed on all pixels of the input image and combined into a single pixel result. rows - Calculations are performed on each row of the input separately, resulting in an output image that is one pixel wide and the same number of rows as the input. columns - Calculations are performed on each column of the input separately, resulting in an output image that is one pixel tall and the same number of columns as the input.\n\n  excludenans - Enable this parameter to skip pixels with a NaN value in the input image. NaNs typically represent errors in previous calculations (such as dividing by zero), but they can also be used to represent invalid pixels in a point cloud image. When most operations encounter a NaN pixel, the resulting output will always be a NaN, so you must enable this parameter to get valid results. If you do not expect NaN values in your input, it is recommended to leave this parameter turned off since it will reduce performance.\n\n\n\n  mask -  - This parameter allows you to exclude certain pixels based on the values in one or more channels in the input. For example, if set to Alpha, only pixels that have a non-zero value in the alpha will be included. This can be useful, for example, if you need to find the average position of a point cloud image that is using an Active channel to indicate which pixels store valid point data.\n\n none - No mask channel. All pixels will be used in the output calculations. red - Only pixels with a non-zero value in the red channel will be used. green - Only pixels with a non-zero value in the green channel will be used. blue - Only pixels with a non-zero value in the blue channel will be used. alpha - Only pixels with a non-zero value in the alpha channel will be used. independent - Each channel will act as its own mask, so that only pixels will non-zero values will be used in the output calculations.\n\n\n\n  outputresolution -  - quickly change the resolution of the 's data.\n\n useinput - Uses the input's resolution. eighth - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. quarter - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. half - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. 2x - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. 4x - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. 8x - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. fit - Fits the width and height to the resolution given below, while maintaining the aspect ratio. limit - The width and height are limited to the resolution given below. If one of the dimensions exceeds the given resolution, the width and height will be reduced to fit inside the given limits while maintaining the aspect ratio. custom - Enables the  parameter below, giving direct control over width and height.\n\n  resolution -  - Enabled only when the  parameter is set to Custom . Some Generators like Constant and Ramp do not use inputs and only use this field to determine their size. The drop down menu on the right provides some commonly used resolutions.\n\n resolutionw - resolutionh -\n\n  resmenu - A drop-down menu with some commonly used resolutions.\n\n\n\n  resmult - Uses the Global  Multiplier found in Edit>Preferences>TOPs. This multiplies all the TOPs resolutions by the set amount. This is handy when working on computers with different hardware specifications. If a project is designed on a desktop workstation with lots of graphics memory, a user on a laptop with only 64MB VRAM can set the Global  Multiplier to a value of half or quarter so it runs at an acceptable speed. By checking this checkbox on, this  is affected by the global multiplier.\n\n\n\n  outputaspect -  - Sets the image aspect ratio allowing any textures to be viewed in any size. Watch for unexpected results when compositing TOPs with different aspect ratios. (You can define images with non-square pixels using xres, yres, aspectx, aspecty where xres/yres != aspectx/aspecty.)\n\n useinput - Uses the input's aspect ratio. resolution - Uses the aspect of the image's defined resolution (ie 512x256 would be 2:1), whereby each pixel is square. custom - Lets you explicitly define a custom aspect ratio in the Aspect parameter below.\n\n  aspect -  - Use when Output Aspect parameter is set to Custom Aspect.\n\n aspect1 - aspect2 -\n\n  armenu - A drop-down menu with some commonly used aspect ratios.\n\n\n\n  inputfiltertype -  - This controls pixel filtering on the input image of the .\n\n nearest - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation. Images will look jaggy when viewing at any zoom level other than Native . linear - Uses linear filtering between pixels. This is how you get  images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native . mipmap - Uses  mipmap filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail.\n\n  fillmode -  - Determine how the  image is displayed in the viewer.\nNOTE:To get an understanding of how TOPs work with images, you will want to set this to Native  as you lay down TOPs when starting out. This will let you see what is actually happening without any automatic viewer resizing.\n\n\n useinput - Uses the same Fill Viewer settings as it's input. fill - Stretches the image to fit the edges of the viewer. width - Stretches image to fit viewer horizontally. height - Stretches image to fit viewer vertically. best - Stretches or squashes image so no part of image is cropped. outside - Stretches or squashes image so image fills viewer while constraining it's proportions. This often leads to part of image getting cropped by viewer. nativeres - Displays the native resolution of the image in the viewer.\n\n  filtertype -  - This controls pixel filtering in the viewers.\n\n nearest - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation. Images will look jaggy when viewing at any zoom level other than Native . linear - Uses linear filtering between pixels. Use this to get  images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native . mipmap - Uses  mipmap filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail.\n\n  npasses - Duplicates the operation of the  the specified number of times. Making this larger than 1 is essentially the same as taking the output from each pass, and passing it into the first input of the node and repeating the process. Other inputs and parameters remain the same for each pass.\n\n\n\n  chanmask - Allows you to choose which channels (R, G, B, or A) the  will operate on. All channels are selected by default.\n\n\n\n  format -  - Format used to store data for each channel in the image (ie. R, G, B, and A). Refer to Pixel Formats for more information.\n\n useinput - Uses the input's pixel format. rgba8fixed - Uses 8-bit integer values for each channel. srgba8fixed - Uses 8-bit integer values for each channel and stores color in sRGB colorspace. rgba16float - Uses 16-bits per color channel, 64-bits per pixel. rgba32float - Uses 32-bits per color channel, 128-bits per pixels. rgb10a2fixed - Uses 10-bits per color channel and 2-bits for alpha, 32-bits total per pixel. rgba16fixed - Uses 16-bits per color channel, 64-bits total per pixel. rgba11float - A RGB floating point format that has 11 bits for the Red and Green channels, and 10-bits for the Blue , 32-bits total per pixel (therefore the same memory usage as 8-bit RGBA). The Alpha channel in this format will always be 1. Values can go above one, but can't be negative. ie. the range is [0, infinite). rgb16float - rgb32float - mono8fixed - Single channel, where RGB will all have the same value, and Alpha will be 1.0. 8-bits per pixel. mono16fixed - Single channel, where RGB will all have the same value, and Alpha will be 1.0. 16-bits per pixel. mono16float - Single channel, where RGB will all have the same value, and Alpha will be 1.0. 16-bits per pixel. mono32float - Single channel, where RGB will all have the same value, and Alpha will be 1.0. 32-bits per pixel. rg8fixed - A 2 channel format, R and G have values, while B is 0 always and Alpha is 1.0. 8-bits per channel, 16-bits total per pixel. rg16fixed - A 2 channel format, R and G have values, while B is 0 always and Alpha is 1.0. 16-bits per channel, 32-bits total per pixel. rg16float - A 2 channel format, R and G have values, while B is 0 always and Alpha is 1.0. 16-bits per channel, 32-bits total per pixel. rg32float - A 2 channel format, R and G have values, while B is 0 always and Alpha is 1.0. 32-bits per channel, 64-bits total per pixel. a8fixed - An Alpha only format that has 8-bits per channel, 8-bits per pixel. a16fixed - An Alpha only format that has 16-bits per channel, 16-bits per pixel. a16float - An Alpha only format that has 16-bits per channel, 16-bits per pixel. a32float - An Alpha only format that has 32-bits per channel, 32-bits per pixel. monoalpha8fixed - A 2 channel format, one value for RGB and one value for Alpha. 8-bits per channel, 16-bits per pixel. monoalpha16fixed - A 2 channel format, one value for RGB and one value for Alpha. 16-bits per channel, 32-bits per pixel. monoalpha16float - A 2 channel format, one value for RGB and one value for Alpha. 16-bits per channel, 32-bits per pixel. monoalpha32float - A 2 channel format, one value for RGB and one value for Alpha. 32-bits per channel, 64-bits per pixel.\n\n\n\n -\n\n\nExtra Information for the Analyze  can be accessed via an Info CHOP.\n\n\n\n - Horizontal resolution of the  in pixels. - Vertical resolution of the  in pixels. - Horizontal aspect of the . - Vertical aspect of the . - Depth of 2D or 3D array if this  contains a 2D or 3D texture array. - Total amount of texture memory used by this .\n - Number of times the operator has cooked since the process started. - Duration of the last cook in milliseconds. - Frame number when this operator was last cooked relative to the component timeline. - Frame number when this operator was last cooked relative to the absolute time. - Time in milliseconds at which the operator started cooking in the frame it was cooked. - Time in milliseconds at which the operator finished cooking in the frame it was cooked. - 1 if operator was cooked this frame. - Number of warnings in this operator if any. - Number of errors in this operator if any.\nTouchDesigner Build: Latest\\n2022.241402021.100002020.200002018.28070before 2018.28070\nTOPs\n• • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • \n\nAn Operator Family that creates, composites and modifies images, and reads/writes images and movies to/from files and the network.

      "description": "The Analyze  takes any image and determines various characteristics of it, such as the average pixel color, the pixel with the maximum luminance, or the min and max values in each channel. The result is stored in a 1x1, 1xN or Nx1 image depending on the chosen scope (See  parameter below). The calculated values can be brought into CHOPs using the TOP to CHOP node.\nNote: When using the minimum and maximum operators, the default behaviour is to select the pixel with the highest value as chosen in the Analyze Channel parameter. For example, if Luminance is selected, the output will be the RGBA values of the pixel with the highest luminance, not the luminance value itself. Similarly, if a single channel is selected e.g. Red, Green, Blue, etc, then the output will be the pixel with the highest red value, rather than the highest values in each channel. To find the min or max values in each channel separately, set the Analyze Channel to RGBA Independent.\nNote: When the operation is set to Count Pixels or Sum, the output image will default to a 32 bit floating point format in order to properly store the output data. For all other operations, the default output format will match the input format. The image format can be set manually using the parameter on the Common page.\nNote: Using the Exclude NaNs or Mask features will slow down the performance of the node and should only be enabled if they are necessary.\nanalyzeTOP_Class\n\nContents\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n  op -  - The operation to perform on the input image.\n\n average - Find the average value in each channel of the input image. This operation is notably slower when the Exclude NaNs or Mask features are used as the node must perform two passes to calculate the results. minimum - Find the pixel with the lowest value as determined by the 'Analyze ' parameter. See Notes in the summary for more details. maximum - Find the pixel with the highest value as determined by the 'Analyze ' parameter. See Notes in the summary for more details. count - Calculates the number of valid pixels in the input image. By default, the output will be fixed based on the dimensions of the image as determined by the '' parameter e.g. Full Image = width*height. When Exclude NaNs is enabled or a Mask is defined, the output will be the number of pixels that pass the mask and NaN checks. By default, when counting pixels the output image will be set to a 32bit floating point format. sum - Calculates the sum of all pixels in the input image by adding all of the values together. By default, the output image will be set to a 32bit floating point format in order to correctly store the output result. minrgb - Find the minimum value from the red, green and blue channels. All channels of the output will contain the same minimum value. minrgba - Find the minimum value from the red, green, blue and alpha channels. All channels of the output will contain the same minimum value. maxrgb - Find the maximum value from the red, green and blue channels. All channels of the output will contain the same maximum value. maxrgba - Find the maximum value from the red, green, blue and alpha channels. All channels of the output will contain the same maximum value.\n\n  analyzechannel -  - Determines what value the operation is being performed on. For example, when the operation is Minimum and the Analyze Channel is Red, the output will be the pixel with the lowest red value (not necessarily the lowest Blue or Green values). To separately find the lowest value in each channel, set this parameter to RGBA Independent.\n\n luminance - The output results are based on the luminance of the input pixels. Luminance is the relative intensity of the pixel based on the values in the RGB channels. Note: the output contains the original RGBA values of the pixel with the highest/lowest luminance, not the luminance value itself. red - Calculations are based only on the value in the red channel. green - Calculations are based only on the value in the green channel. blue - Calculations are based only on the value in the blue channel. alpha - Calculations are based only on the value in the alpha channel. rgbaverage - Calculations are based on the average value of the RGB channels. average - Calculations are based on the average value of the RGBA channels. independent - Calculations are performed on each channels separately. Use this mode if you want to find the highest/lowest values in each channel. rgbmax - max -\n\n  scope -  - Determines how pixels are grouped together to calculate the results.\n\n image - Calculations are performed on all pixels of the input image and combined into a single pixel result. rows - Calculations are performed on each row of the input separately, resulting in an output image that is one pixel wide and the same number of rows as the input. columns - Calculations are performed on each column of the input separately, resulting in an output image that is one pixel tall and the same number of columns as the input.\n\n  excludenans - Enable this parameter to skip pixels with a NaN value in the input image. NaNs typically represent errors in previous calculations (such as dividing by zero), but they can also be used to represent invalid pixels in a point cloud image. When most operations encounter a NaN pixel, the resulting output will always be a NaN, so you must enable this parameter to get valid results. If you do not expect NaN values in your input, it is recommended to leave this parameter turned off since it will reduce performance.\n\n\n\n  mask -  - This parameter allows you to exclude certain pixels based on the values in one or more channels in the input. For example, if set to Alpha, only pixels that have a non-zero value in the alpha will be included. This can be useful, for example, if you need to find the average position of a point cloud image that is using an Active channel to indicate which pixels store valid point data.\n\n none - No mask channel. All pixels will be used in the output calculations. red - Only pixels with a non-zero value in the red channel will be used. green - Only pixels with a non-zero value in the green channel will be used. blue - Only pixels with a non-zero value in the blue channel will be used. alpha - Only pixels with a non-zero value in the alpha channel will be used. independent - Each channel will act as its own mask, so that only pixels will non-zero values will be used in the output calculations.\n\n\n\n  outputresolution -  - quickly change the resolution of the 's data.\n\n useinput - Uses the input's resolution. eighth - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. quarter - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. half - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. 2x - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. 4x - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. 8x - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. fit - Fits the width and height to the resolution given below, while maintaining the aspect ratio. limit - The width and height are limited to the resolution given below. If one of the dimensions exceeds the given resolution, the width and height will be reduced to fit inside the given limits while maintaining the aspect ratio. custom - Enables the  parameter below, giving direct control over width and height.\n\n  resolution -  - Enabled only when the  parameter is set to Custom . Some Generators like Constant and Ramp do not use inputs and only use this field to determine their size. The drop down menu on the right provides some commonly used resolutions.\n\n resolutionw - resolutionh -\n\n  resmenu - A drop-down menu with some commonly used resolutions.\n\n\n\n  resmult - Uses the Global  Multiplier found in Edit>Preferences>TOPs. This multiplies all the TOPs resolutions by the set amount. This is handy when working on computers with different hardware specifications. If a project is designed on a desktop workstation with lots of graphics memory, a user on a laptop with only 64MB VRAM can set the Global  Multiplier to a value of half or quarter so it runs at an acceptable speed. By checking this checkbox on, this  is affected by the global multiplier.\n\n\n\n  outputaspect -  - Sets the image aspect ratio allowing any textures to be viewed in any size. Watch for unexpected results when compositing TOPs with different aspect ratios. (You can define images with non-square pixels using xres, yres, aspectx, aspecty where xres/yres != aspectx/aspecty.)\n\n useinput - Uses the input's aspect ratio. resolution - Uses the aspect of the image's defined resolution (ie 512x256 would be 2:1), whereby each pixel is square. custom - Lets you explicitly define a custom aspect ratio in the Aspect parameter below.\n\n  aspect -  - Use when Output Aspect parameter is set to Custom Aspect.\n\n aspect1 - aspect2 -\n\n  armenu - A drop-down menu with some commonly used aspect ratios.\n\n\n\n  inputfiltertype -  - This controls pixel filtering on the input image of the .\n\n nearest - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation. Images will look jaggy when viewing at any zoom level other than Native . linear - Uses linear filtering between pixels. This is how you get  images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native . mipmap - Uses  mipmap filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail.\n\n  fillmode -  - Determine how the  image is displayed in the viewer.\nNOTE:To get an understanding of how TOPs work with images, you will want to set this to Native  as you lay down TOPs when starting out. This will let you see what is actually happening without any automatic viewer resizing.\n\n\n useinput - Uses the same Fill Viewer settings as it's input. fill - Stretches the image to fit the edges of the viewer. width - Stretches image to fit viewer horizontally. height - Stretches image to fit viewer vertically. best - Stretches or squashes image so no part of image is cropped. outside - Stretches or squashes image so image fills viewer while constraining it's proportions. This often leads to part of image getting cropped by viewer. nativeres - Displays the native resolution of the image in the viewer.\n\n  filtertype -  - This controls pixel filtering in the viewers.\n\n nearest - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation. Images will look jaggy when viewing at any zoom level other than Native . linear - Uses linear filtering between pixels. Use this to get  images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native . mipmap - Uses  mipmap filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail.\n\n  npasses - Duplicates the operation of the  the specified number of times. Making this larger than 1 is essentially the same as taking the output from each pass, and passing it into the first input of the node and repeating the process. Other inputs and parameters remain the same for each pass.\n\n\n\n  chanmask - Allows you to choose which channels (R, G, B, or A) the  will operate on. All channels are selected by default.\n\n\n\n  format -  - Format used to store data for each channel in the image (ie. R, G, B, and A). Refer to Pixel Formats for more information.\n\n useinput - Uses the input's pixel format. rgba8fixed - Uses 8-bit integer values for each channel. srgba8fixed - Uses 8-bit integer values for each channel and stores color in sRGB colorspace. rgba16float - Uses 16-bits per color channel, 64-bits per pixel. rgba32float - Uses 32-bits per color channel, 128-bits per pixels. rgb10a2fixed - Uses 10-bits per color channel and 2-bits for alpha, 32-bits total per pixel. rgba16fixed - Uses 16-bits per color channel, 64-bits total per pixel. rgba11float - A RGB floating point format that has 11 bits for the Red and Green channels, and 10-bits for the Blue , 32-bits total per pixel (therefore the same memory usage as 8-bit RGBA). The Alpha channel in this format will always be 1. Values can go above one, but can't be negative. ie. the range is [0, infinite). rgb16float - rgb32float - mono8fixed - Single channel, where RGB will all have the same value, and Alpha will be 1.0. 8-bits per pixel. mono16fixed - Single channel, where RGB will all have the same value, and Alpha will be 1.0. 16-bits per pixel. mono16float - Single channel, where RGB will all have the same value, and Alpha will be 1.0. 16-bits per pixel. mono32float - Single channel, where RGB will all have the same value, and Alpha will be 1.0. 32-bits per pixel. rg8fixed - A 2 channel format, R and G have values, while B is 0 always and Alpha is 1.0. 8-bits per channel, 16-bits total per pixel. rg16fixed - A 2 channel format, R and G have values, while B is 0 always and Alpha is 1.0. 16-bits per channel, 32-bits total per pixel. rg16float - A 2 channel format, R and G have values, while B is 0 always and Alpha is 1.0. 16-bits per channel, 32-bits total per pixel. rg32float - A 2 channel format, R and G have values, while B is 0 always and Alpha is 1.0. 32-bits per channel, 64-bits total per pixel. a8fixed - An Alpha only format that has 8-bits per channel, 8-bits per pixel. a16fixed - An Alpha only format that has 16-bits per channel, 16-bits per pixel. a16float - An Alpha only format that has 16-bits per channel, 16-bits per pixel. a32float - An Alpha only format that has 32-bits per channel, 32-bits per pixel. monoalpha8fixed - A 2 channel format, one value for RGB and one value for Alpha. 8-bits per channel, 16-bits per pixel. monoalpha16fixed - A 2 channel format, one value for RGB and one value for Alpha. 16-bits per channel, 32-bits per pixel. monoalpha16float - A 2 channel format, one value for RGB and one value for Alpha. 16-bits per channel, 32-bits per pixel. monoalpha32float - A 2 channel format, one value for RGB and one value for Alpha. 32-bits per channel, 64-bits per pixel.\n\n\n\n -\n\n\nExtra Information for the Analyze  can be accessed via an Info CHOP.\n\n\n\n - Horizontal resolution of the  in pixels. - Vertical resolution of the  in pixels. - Horizontal aspect of the . - Vertical aspect of the . - Depth of 2D or 3D array if this  contains a 2D or 3D texture array. - Total amount of texture memory used by this .\n - Number of times the operator has cooked since the process started. - Duration of the last cook in milliseconds. - Frame number when this operator was last cooked relative to the component timeline. - Frame number when this operator was last cooked relative to the absolute time. - Time in milliseconds at which the operator started cooking in the frame it was cooked. - Time in milliseconds at which the operator finished cooking in the frame it was cooked. - 1 if operator was cooked this frame. - Number of warnings in this operator if any. - Number of errors in this operator if any.\nTouchDesigner Build: Latest\\n2022.241402021.100002020.200002018.28070before 2018.28070\nTOPs\n• • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • \n\nAn Operator Family that creates, composites and modifies images, and reads/writes images and movies to/from files and the network.
