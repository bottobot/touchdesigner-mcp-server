A band pass filter is used to extract a frequency range (i.e. extracting a person's voice from background noise) and a band reject filter is used to cut out a frequency range.\t\t\t\nIf a certain frequency lies outside the pass band, sounds at that frequency will be reduced in magnitude. The farther outside the pass band the frequency is, the more it will be reduced.\t\t\t\nThe Cutoff frequency is also known as the \"half-power\" frequency. A wave at the cutoff frequency will be reduced to half power.\t\t\t\nThe Rolloff of a filter determines how quickly the drop occurs at its Cutoff frequencies. A low rolloff will produce a gradual filter falloff (more of the sounds outside the frequency range are heard), and a high rolloff will produce a sharp filter falloff.\t\t\t\nRefer to audio filter for more insight.\t\t\t\nYou can see the effects of the Audio Filter  by passing it white noise from an Oscillator  and sending the result to an Audio Spectrum . The Audio Filter  is implemented with a 4-pole filter internally.\t\t\t\nMoving the Dry / Wet parameter to Dry will bring back the incoming signal un-affected.\t\t\t\nInput 2: See  Cutoff Modulation Channels\t\t\t\nSee Audio Para EQ CHOP, Audio Band EQ CHOP, Audio Spectrum CHOP, Audio Dynamics CHOP\naudiofilterCHOP_Class\n\nContents\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n  filter -  - The filter type:\n\n lowpass - All frequencies below the High Cutoff are passed through the filter (the \"pass band\"). highpass - All frequencies above the Low Cutoff are passed through. bandpass - All frequencies between the Low and High Cutoff are passed through. bandreject - All frequencies above the High Cutoff and below the Low Cutoff are passed though.\n\t\t\n  units -  - The filter cutoff frequency can be expressed in Hz (menu set to Frequency) or power-of-10 (menu set to Logarithmic). It enables one of the next 2 Filter Cutoff parameters.\n\n logarithmic - frequency -\n\t\t\n  cutofflog - The filter cutoff frequency expressed in power-of-10, where value 0 translates to 1 Hz (10**0), value 1 is 10 Hz (10**1), value 2 is 100 Hz (10**2), value 3 is 1000 Hz, value 4 is 10,000 Hz, value 4.5 is 31,623 Hz. The parameter in this form gives more meaningful range in relation to human hearing, as increasing the parameter by 1 raises the frequency by about 3 octaves.\n\n\n\t\t\n  cutofffrequency - The filter cutoff frequency expressed in Hz (cycles per second). This parameter set to 1000 has exactly the same effect as the above parameter set to 3.\n\n\n\t\t\n  resonance - Increasing the resonance will boost the loudness of the passed frequencies near the cutoff frequency.\n\n\n\t\t\n  rolloff - Rolloff determines how much the levels decrease near the cutoff frequency. This parameter will make it decrease by 12 decibels (dB) per octave, to, more extremely, 24 decibels per octave. 12 and 24 decibels correspond to levels of about 1/4 and 1/16.\n\n\n\t\t\n  drywet - As this parameter is reduced from 1 (Wet) toward 0 (Dry), it removes the effect of the filter.\n\n\n\n\n\n  timeslice - Turning this on forces the channels to be \"Time Sliced\".  A  is the time between the last cook frame and the current cook frame.\n\n\n\n  scope - To determine which channels get affected, some CHOPs use a  string on the Common page. See Pattern Matching.\n\n\n\n  srselect -  - Handle cases where multiple input CHOPs' sample rates are different. When Resampling occurs, the curves are interpolated according to the Interpolation Method Option, or \"Linear\" if the Interpolate Options are not available.\n\n first - Use rate of first input to resample others. max - Resample to the highest sample rate. min - Resample to the lowest sample rate. err - Doesn't accept conflicting sample rates.\n\n  exportmethod -  - This will determine how to connect the  channel to the parameter. Refer to the Export article for more information.\n\n datindex - Uses the docked  table and references the channel via the index of the channel in the . datname - Uses the docked  table and references the channel via the name of the channel in the . autoname - The channel is the full destination of where to export to, such has geo1/transform1:tx.\n\n  autoexportroot - This path points to the root node where all of the paths that exporting by Channel Name is : are relative to.\n\n\n\n  exporttable - The  used to hold the export information when using the  Table  Methods (See above).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second input is the Cutoff Modulation Channels, which allows the filter parameters to be changed within the 's time slice interval (typically 1/60 sec). This prevents audible stepping of the parameters that you are changing quickly.\nYou can send in a channel called cutofffrequency to override the value of the parameter. You would do this if you want to adjust the cutoff frequency very quickly. The parameter can only change as fast as the timeline rate, typically 1/60 seconds. Changed quickly, the stepping in frequency is noticeable. To improve on that, you would send a cutofffrequency channel in that is at a higher sample rate, like 400, which you can set in a  like an LFO .\n\n\n -\n -\n\nExtra Information for the Audio Filter  can be accessed via an Info CHOP.\n\n\n\n - Start of the  interval in samples. - Number of samples in the . - The samplerate of the channels in frames per second. - Number of channels in the . - 1 if  is  enabled, 0 otherwise. - A count of how often the export connections have been updated.\n - Number of times the operator has cooked since the process started. - Duration of the last cook in milliseconds. - Frame number when this operator was last cooked relative to the component timeline. - Frame number when this operator was last cooked relative to the absolute time. - Time in milliseconds at which the operator started cooking in the frame it was cooked. - Time in milliseconds at which the operator finished cooking in the frame it was cooked. - 1 if operator was cooked this frame. - Number of warnings in this operator if any. - Number of errors in this operator if any.\nTouchDesigner Build: Latest\\n2022.241402021.100002018.28070before 2018.28070\nCHOPs\n• • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • \n\nAn Operator Family which operate on Channels (a sequence of numbers (Samples)) which are used for animation, audio, mathematics, simulation, logic, UI construction, and data streamed from/to devices and protocols.\n\n\n\nOperators that need 1 or more inputs are called Filters in TouchDesigner, like a Math CHOP.

In contrast, the overall timeline has a Frame Rate, which is the number of frames to cook and display per second, generally your monitor display frequency, default 60.\n\n\n\nExporting is the connection of CHOP channels to parameters of operators. The output of each exporting CHOP is one or more channels, active only while the CHOP Viewer is on. The current value of a channel can be exported to a parameter of any operator, overriding that parameter's value. See Parameter.\n\n\n\nAn Operator Family that manipulates text strings: multi-line text or tables. Multi-line text is often a python Script or GLSL Shader, but can be any multi-line text.

The Network Path or Path for root is simply /.

A  is the time between the last cook frame and the current cook frame.\n\n\n\n  scope - To determine which channels get affected, some CHOPs use a  string on the Common page. See Pattern Matching.\n\n\n\n  srselect -  - Handle cases where multiple input CHOPs' sample rates are different. When Resampling occurs, the curves are interpolated according to the Interpolation Method Option, or \"Linear\" if the Interpolate Options are not available.\n\n first - Use rate of first input to resample others. max - Resample to the highest sample rate. min - Resample to the lowest sample rate. err - Doesn't accept conflicting sample rates.\n\n  exportmethod -  - This will determine how to connect the  channel to the parameter. Refer to the Export article for more information.\n\n datindex - Uses the docked  table and references the channel via the index of the channel in the . datname - Uses the docked  table and references the channel via the name of the channel in the . autoname - The channel is the full destination of where to export to, such has geo1/transform1:tx.\n\n  autoexportroot - This path points to the root node where all of the paths that exporting by Channel Name is : are relative to.\n\n\n\n  exporttable - The  used to hold the export information when using the  Table  Methods (See above).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second input is the Cutoff Modulation Channels, which allows the filter parameters to be changed within the 's time slice interval (typically 1/60 sec). This prevents audible stepping of the parameters that you are changing quickly.\nYou can send in a channel called cutofffrequency to override the value of the parameter. You would do this if you want to adjust the cutoff frequency very quickly. The parameter can only change as fast as the timeline rate, typically 1/60 seconds. Changed quickly, the stepping in frequency is noticeable. To improve on that, you would send a cutofffrequency channel in that is at a higher sample rate, like 400, which you can set in a  like an LFO .\n\n\n -\n -\n\nExtra Information for the Audio Filter  can be accessed via an Info CHOP.\n\n\n\n - Start of the  interval in samples. - Number of samples in the . - The samplerate of the channels in frames per second. - Number of channels in the . - 1 if  is  enabled, 0 otherwise. - A count of how often the export connections have been updated.\n - Number of times the operator has cooked since the process started. - Duration of the last cook in milliseconds. - Frame number when this operator was last cooked relative to the component timeline. - Frame number when this operator was last cooked relative to the absolute time. - Time in milliseconds at which the operator started cooking in the frame it was cooked. - Time in milliseconds at which the operator finished cooking in the frame it was cooked. - 1 if operator was cooked this frame. - Number of warnings in this operator if any. - Number of errors in this operator if any.\nTouchDesigner Build: Latest\\n2022.241402021.100002018.28070before 2018.28070\nCHOPs\n• • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • \n\nAn Operator Family which operate on Channels (a sequence of numbers (Samples)) which are used for animation, audio, mathematics, simulation, logic, UI construction, and data streamed from/to devices and protocols.\n\n\n\nOperators that need 1 or more inputs are called Filters in TouchDesigner, like a Math CHOP. See Generator.\n\n\n\nA Time Slice is the time from the last cook frame to the current cook frame. In CHOPs it is the set of short channels that contain the CHOP channels' samples between the last and the current cook frame.\n\n\n\nA parameter in most CHOPs that restricts which channels of that CHOP will be affected. Normally all channels of a CHOP are affected by the operator. TOPs have Channel Mask, a similar feature.\n\n\n\nsamples-per-second of a CHOP. Each CHOP in your network has a sample rate. In contrast, the overall timeline has a Frame Rate, which is the number of frames to cook and display per second, generally your monitor display frequency, default 60.\n\n\n\nExporting is the connection of CHOP channels to parameters of operators. The output of each exporting CHOP is one or more channels, active only while the CHOP Viewer is on. The current value of a channel can be exported to a parameter of any operator, overriding that parameter's value. See Parameter.\n\n\n\nAn Operator Family that manipulates text strings: multi-line text or tables. Multi-line text is often a python Script or GLSL Shader, but can be any multi-line text. Tables are rows and columns of cells, each containing a text string.\n\n\n\nThe location of an operator within the TouchDesigner environment, for example, /geo1/circle1, a node called circle1 in a component called geo1. The path / is called Root. This path is displayed at the top of every Pane, showing which Component's network you are currently in. To refer instead to a filesystem folder, directory, disk file or http: address, see Folder.\n\n\n\nEvery operator in TouchDesigner has a set of control Parameters that can be integer or floating point numbers, menus, binary toggles, text strings or operator paths, which determine the output of the operator.\n\n\n\nTouchDesigner is a hierarchy of components. \"root\" is the top-most network in the hierarchy. The Network Path or Path for root is simply /. A typical path is /project1/moviein1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Audio_Filter_CHOP&oldid=24008\"",
