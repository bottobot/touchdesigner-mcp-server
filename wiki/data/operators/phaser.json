Phaser outputs one channel with multi-samples. Each sample animates from 0 to 1 over a cycle, but each sample value rises from 0 and arrives at 1 at different times.\nFor example, you may have a set of N objects that you want to animate from a start position to an end position. You set Num Samples to N, which will make the Phaser  output one channel with N samples that will animate the samples from 0 to 1 and be interpolated with an easing function. In the Phaser  the start-to-end cycle is controlled by the first input of the , which is expected to be one channel with value between 0 to 1. \nThe 0-1 values can be used with the Lookup CHOP to animate groups of channels.\nBy default the timing is staggered uniformly.  If you want to stagger their transitions irregularly, you use the second input, a set of values in one  channel (typically N samples) that are between 0 and 1. The phase value specifies the object's timing relationship with the rest of those in the . A phase value of 1 corresponds to an animated object thats \"ahead of the pack\" (ie. it will start animating before the others). A value of 0 corresponds to an object that is late (ie. it will be the last to start easing/animating). If a phase input is not provided then the phase will simply be i/N where N is the total number of objects (ie. samples), and i is the index of the current sample.\nThere is also a notion of an \"Edge\" in the Phaser, which describes the cohesiveness of the group of animated objects and how fast the samples rise. A small value will cause the objects to go through the animation very quickly or at high value, very slowly and in unison with other samples.\nLook at David Braun's TouchDesigner Summit Talk to see the background of the Phaser . Its functionality draws heavily from David's research and development in quantitative easing. \nSee also the OP Snippets.\nphaserCHOP_Class\n\nContents\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n  edge - The separation edge of the phasing between two states.

Channels can be Exported to Parameters.\n\n\n\nA Time Slice is the time from the last cook frame to the current cook frame.

In contrast, the overall timeline has a Frame Rate, which is the number of frames to cook and display per second, generally your monitor display frequency, default 60.\n\n\n\nExporting is the connection of CHOP channels to parameters of operators. The output of each exporting CHOP is one or more channels, active only while the CHOP Viewer is on. The current value of a channel can be exported to a parameter of any operator, overriding that parameter's value. See Parameter.\n\n\n\nAn Operator Family that manipulates text strings: multi-line text or tables. Multi-line text is often a python Script or GLSL Shader, but can be any multi-line text. Tables are rows and columns of cells, each containing a text string.\n\n\n\nThe location of an operator within the TouchDesigner environment, for example, /geo1/circle1, a node called circle1 in a component called geo1.

To refer instead to a filesystem folder, directory, disk file or http: address, see Folder.\n\n\n\nEvery operator in TouchDesigner has a set of control Parameters that can be integer or floating point numbers, menus, binary toggles, text strings or operator paths, which determine the output of the operator.\n\n\n\nTouchDesigner is a hierarchy of components. \"root\" is the top-most network in the hierarchy.

The  should only contain one channel; all other channels except the first will be ignored.\n - When wired the Phaser 's output will mirror the phase input's. However, if Mult-Channel Output Format is selected it will in effect transpose the output.\n - Edge samples will be used instead of the Edge parameter.\n\n\nExtra Information for the Phaser  can be accessed via an Info CHOP.\n\n\n\n - Start of the  interval in samples. - Number of samples in the . - The samplerate of the channels in frames per second. - Number of channels in the . - 1 if  is  enabled, 0 otherwise. - A count of how often the export connections have been updated.\n - Number of times the operator has cooked since the process started. - Duration of the last cook in milliseconds. - Frame number when this operator was last cooked relative to the component timeline. - Frame number when this operator was last cooked relative to the absolute time. - Time in milliseconds at which the operator started cooking in the frame it was cooked. - Time in milliseconds at which the operator finished cooking in the frame it was cooked. - 1 if operator was cooked this frame. - Number of warnings in this operator if any. - Number of errors in this operator if any.\nTouchDesigner Build: Latest\\nwikieditorwikieditor2021.10000before 2021.10000\nCHOPs\n• • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • \n\nAn Operator Family which operate on Channels (a sequence of numbers (Samples)) which are used for animation, audio, mathematics, simulation, logic, UI construction, and data streamed from/to devices and protocols.\n\n\n\nA CHOP outputs one or more channels, where a channel is simply a sequence of numbers (Samples), representing motion, audio, etc. Channels are passed between CHOPs in TouchDesigner networks. Channels can be Exported to Parameters.\n\n\n\nA Time Slice is the time from the last cook frame to the current cook frame. In CHOPs it is the set of short channels that contain the CHOP channels' samples between the last and the current cook frame.\n\n\n\nA parameter in most CHOPs that restricts which channels of that CHOP will be affected. Normally all channels of a CHOP are affected by the operator. TOPs have Channel Mask, a similar feature.\n\n\n\nsamples-per-second of a CHOP. Each CHOP in your network has a sample rate. In contrast, the overall timeline has a Frame Rate, which is the number of frames to cook and display per second, generally your monitor display frequency, default 60.\n\n\n\nExporting is the connection of CHOP channels to parameters of operators. The output of each exporting CHOP is one or more channels, active only while the CHOP Viewer is on. The current value of a channel can be exported to a parameter of any operator, overriding that parameter's value. See Parameter.\n\n\n\nAn Operator Family that manipulates text strings: multi-line text or tables. Multi-line text is often a python Script or GLSL Shader, but can be any multi-line text. Tables are rows and columns of cells, each containing a text string.\n\n\n\nThe location of an operator within the TouchDesigner environment, for example, /geo1/circle1, a node called circle1 in a component called geo1. The path / is called Root. This path is displayed at the top of every Pane, showing which Component's network you are currently in. To refer instead to a filesystem folder, directory, disk file or http: address, see Folder.\n\n\n\nEvery operator in TouchDesigner has a set of control Parameters that can be integer or floating point numbers, menus, binary toggles, text strings or operator paths, which determine the output of the operator.\n\n\n\nTouchDesigner is a hierarchy of components. \"root\" is the top-most network in the hierarchy. The Network Path or Path for root is simply /. A typical path is /project1/moviein1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Phaser_CHOP&oldid=29532\"",
