      "description": "From Derivative\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tJump to navigation\n\t\tJump to search\n\t\t\nThe Texture 3D  creates a 3D texture map. It saves a series of images in one array of pixels. This  can be used with Time Machine TOP, as well as materials. Using materials, a particular image in this array can be accessed by specifying a W texture coordinate, while the U and V coordinates are used to specify a texture location on that image. Refer to the 3D Texture article for more information.\t\t\nThe Texture 3D  is similar to the Cache TOP which holds a set of images in a different form: the images are separate and you cannot use the W texture coordinate in a material to interpolate to access all of them in a shader.\t\t\t\nThe Texture 3D  replaces one slice of its 3D data with its input every frame. When it has filled up all of its slices it wraps around and starts overwriting the oldest slice.\t\t\t\nThe Texture 3D  can also create a 2D Texture Array. 2D Texture arrays are much like 3d textures, except are sampled using a non-normalized w texture coordinate. (i.e, 0 is the first slice, 1 is the 2nd slice, 2 is the 3rd slice etc.). Texture arrays also don't support blending between different slices when sampling at coordinate that falls between two slices. This a much faster alternative to 3d textures when interpolation between slices is not required. The non-normalized w coordinate makes it very easy to directly access a particular slice in the array. 2D Texture arrays also don't have a concept of w extend mode: they only work in their 0->(N-1) range.\nLocking the Texture 3D  preserves the entire 3D and 2D array in a .toe or .tox file.\ntexture3dTOP_Class\n\nContents\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n  type -  - Specifies the texture type to create.\n\n texture3d - A series of images in an array (slices). Slices can be blended when samping a coordinate in between two slices. Slices are accessed using the W texture coordinate. texture2darray - A series of images in an array which does not support blending between slices.  The W texture coordinate is non-normalized and dosn't have a concept of w extend mode: they only work in their 0->(N-1) range.\n\t\t\n  active - When set to 1, the Texture 3D  will fill up it cache with images. The texture3D  replaces a slice of its 3d data with its input every frame. When it has filled up all of its slices it wraps around and starts overwriting the oldest slice.\n\n\n\t\t\n  replacesingle - While this is set > 0, the Texture 3D  will replace the slice at 'Replace Index' with the input image. This allows you to replace specific slices of the 3D texture at will.\n\n\n\t\t\n  replacesinglepulse - Replace an image for the single frame this was pulsed.\n\n\n\t\t\n  replaceindex - Select the slice index that will be replaced by the input, when 'Replace Single' is turned on.\n\n\n\t\t\n  prefill - This feature is used to pre-setup all of the slices of the 3D texture in a single cook. When set to 1, it will fill the cache. If set to 1 during playback, it will fill immediately. If set to 1 and saved out, then next time the file is opened the cache will pre-fill. It sets up the cache by cooking its inputs at $F = 1, $F = 2, $F = 3 etc. up until the number of slice it needs to fill. Refer to Pre-Filling for more information.\n\n\n\t\t\n  prefillpulse - Pre-fills a single image during the frame this was pulsed.\n\n\n\t\t\n  cachesize - The number of images the Texture 3D  will hold. This is the number of 3D slices in the texture.\n\n\n\t\t\n  step - This parameter sets how many frames pass before the  grabs one into cache. A Sample Step of 1 will grab each consecutive frame, a Sample Step of 2 will grab every other frame, and so on.\t\nWhen Prefilling you would normally setup the inputs to the Texture 3D node in some way that is tied to $F. Such as a Movie File In  where set the Specify Index parameter to $F - 1 (since 0 is the first frame). Or a Noise  that is changing it's translation based on $F. If Step Size is 3, it would cook frame 1, 4, 7 etc.\n\n\n\t\t\n  reset - When set to 1, the cache is flushed and the  is reset.\n\n\n\t\t\n  resetpulse - Instantly empty the cache.\n\n\n\n\n\n  outputresolution -  - quickly change the resolution of the 's data.\n\n useinput - Uses the input's resolution. eighth - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. quarter - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. half - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. 2x - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. 4x - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. 8x - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. fit - Fits the width and height to the resolution given below, while maintaining the aspect ratio. limit - The width and height are limited to the resolution given below. If one of the dimensions exceeds the given resolution, the width and height will be reduced to fit inside the given limits while maintaining the aspect ratio. custom - Enables the  parameter below, giving direct control over width and height.\n\n  resolution -  - Enabled only when the  parameter is set to Custom . Some Generators like Constant and Ramp do not use inputs and only use this field to determine their size.

This multiplies all the TOPs resolutions by the set amount. This is handy when working on computers with different hardware specifications. If a project is designed on a desktop workstation with lots of graphics memory, a user on a laptop with only 64MB VRAM can set the Global  Multiplier to a value of half or quarter so it runs at an acceptable speed. By checking this checkbox on, this  is affected by the global multiplier.\n\n\n\n  outputaspect -  - Sets the image aspect ratio allowing any textures to be viewed in any size. Watch for unexpected results when compositing TOPs with different aspect ratios. (You can define images with non-square pixels using xres, yres, aspectx, aspecty where xres/yres != aspectx/aspecty.)\n\n useinput - Uses the input's aspect ratio. resolution - Uses the aspect of the image's defined resolution (ie 512x256 would be 2:1), whereby each pixel is square. custom - Lets you explicitly define a custom aspect ratio in the Aspect parameter below.\n\n  aspect -  - Use when Output Aspect parameter is set to Custom Aspect.\n\n aspect1 - aspect2 -\n\n  armenu - A drop-down menu with some commonly used aspect ratios.\n\n\n\n  inputfiltertype -  - This controls pixel filtering on the input image of the .\n\n nearest - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation.

This is how you get  images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native . mipmap - Uses  mipmap filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail.\n\n  fillmode -  - Determine how the  image is displayed in the viewer.\nNOTE:To get an understanding of how TOPs work with images, you will want to set this to Native  as you lay down TOPs when starting out. This will let you see what is actually happening without any automatic viewer resizing.\n\n\n useinput - Uses the same Fill Viewer settings as it's input. fill - Stretches the image to fit the edges of the viewer. width - Stretches image to fit viewer horizontally. height - Stretches image to fit viewer vertically. best - Stretches or squashes image so no part of image is cropped. outside - Stretches or squashes image so image fills viewer while constraining it's proportions. This often leads to part of image getting cropped by viewer. nativeres - Displays the native resolution of the image in the viewer.\n\n  filtertype -  - This controls pixel filtering in the viewers.\n\n nearest - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation. Images will look jaggy when viewing at any zoom level other than Native . linear - Uses linear filtering between pixels. Use this to get  images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native . mipmap - Uses  mipmap filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail.\n\n  npasses - Duplicates the operation of the  the specified number of times. Making this larger than 1 is essentially the same as taking the output from each pass, and passing it into the first input of the node and repeating the process. Other inputs and parameters remain the same for each pass.\n\n\n\n  chanmask - Allows you to choose which channels (R, G, B, or A) the  will operate on.

      "description": "The Texture 3D  creates a 3D texture map. It saves a series of images in one array of pixels. This  can be used with Time Machine TOP, as well as materials. Using materials, a particular image in this array can be accessed by specifying a W texture coordinate, while the U and V coordinates are used to specify a texture location on that image. Refer to the 3D Texture article for more information.\t\t\nThe Texture 3D  is similar to the Cache TOP which holds a set of images in a different form: the images are separate and you cannot use the W texture coordinate in a material to interpolate to access all of them in a shader.\t\t\t\nThe Texture 3D  replaces one slice of its 3D data with its input every frame. When it has filled up all of its slices it wraps around and starts overwriting the oldest slice.\t\t\t\nThe Texture 3D  can also create a 2D Texture Array. 2D Texture arrays are much like 3d textures, except are sampled using a non-normalized w texture coordinate. (i.e, 0 is the first slice, 1 is the 2nd slice, 2 is the 3rd slice etc.). Texture arrays also don't support blending between different slices when sampling at coordinate that falls between two slices. This a much faster alternative to 3d textures when interpolation between slices is not required. The non-normalized w coordinate makes it very easy to directly access a particular slice in the array. 2D Texture arrays also don't have a concept of w extend mode: they only work in their 0->(N-1) range.\nLocking the Texture 3D  preserves the entire 3D and 2D array in a .toe or .tox file.\ntexture3dTOP_Class\n\nContents\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n  type -  - Specifies the texture type to create.\n\n texture3d - A series of images in an array (slices). Slices can be blended when samping a coordinate in between two slices. Slices are accessed using the W texture coordinate. texture2darray - A series of images in an array which does not support blending between slices.  The W texture coordinate is non-normalized and dosn't have a concept of w extend mode: they only work in their 0->(N-1) range.\n\t\t\n  active - When set to 1, the Texture 3D  will fill up it cache with images. The texture3D  replaces a slice of its 3d data with its input every frame. When it has filled up all of its slices it wraps around and starts overwriting the oldest slice.\n\n\n\t\t\n  replacesingle - While this is set > 0, the Texture 3D  will replace the slice at 'Replace Index' with the input image. This allows you to replace specific slices of the 3D texture at will.\n\n\n\t\t\n  replacesinglepulse - Replace an image for the single frame this was pulsed.\n\n\n\t\t\n  replaceindex - Select the slice index that will be replaced by the input, when 'Replace Single' is turned on.\n\n\n\t\t\n  prefill - This feature is used to pre-setup all of the slices of the 3D texture in a single cook. When set to 1, it will fill the cache. If set to 1 during playback, it will fill immediately. If set to 1 and saved out, then next time the file is opened the cache will pre-fill. It sets up the cache by cooking its inputs at $F = 1, $F = 2, $F = 3 etc. up until the number of slice it needs to fill. Refer to Pre-Filling for more information.\n\n\n\t\t\n  prefillpulse - Pre-fills a single image during the frame this was pulsed.\n\n\n\t\t\n  cachesize - The number of images the Texture 3D  will hold. This is the number of 3D slices in the texture.\n\n\n\t\t\n  step - This parameter sets how many frames pass before the  grabs one into cache. A Sample Step of 1 will grab each consecutive frame, a Sample Step of 2 will grab every other frame, and so on.\t\nWhen Prefilling you would normally setup the inputs to the Texture 3D node in some way that is tied to $F. Such as a Movie File In  where set the Specify Index parameter to $F - 1 (since 0 is the first frame). Or a Noise  that is changing it's translation based on $F. If Step Size is 3, it would cook frame 1, 4, 7 etc.\n\n\n\t\t\n  reset - When set to 1, the cache is flushed and the  is reset.\n\n\n\t\t\n  resetpulse - Instantly empty the cache.\n\n\n\n\n\n  outputresolution -  - quickly change the resolution of the 's data.\n\n useinput - Uses the input's resolution. eighth - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. quarter - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. half - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. 2x - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. 4x - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. 8x - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. fit - Fits the width and height to the resolution given below, while maintaining the aspect ratio. limit - The width and height are limited to the resolution given below. If one of the dimensions exceeds the given resolution, the width and height will be reduced to fit inside the given limits while maintaining the aspect ratio. custom - Enables the  parameter below, giving direct control over width and height.\n\n  resolution -  - Enabled only when the  parameter is set to Custom . Some Generators like Constant and Ramp do not use inputs and only use this field to determine their size. The drop down menu on the right provides some commonly used resolutions.\n\n resolutionw - resolutionh -\n\n  resmenu - A drop-down menu with some commonly used resolutions.\n\n\n\n  resmult - Uses the Global  Multiplier found in Edit>Preferences>TOPs. This multiplies all the TOPs resolutions by the set amount. This is handy when working on computers with different hardware specifications. If a project is designed on a desktop workstation with lots of graphics memory, a user on a laptop with only 64MB VRAM can set the Global  Multiplier to a value of half or quarter so it runs at an acceptable speed. By checking this checkbox on, this  is affected by the global multiplier.\n\n\n\n  outputaspect -  - Sets the image aspect ratio allowing any textures to be viewed in any size. Watch for unexpected results when compositing TOPs with different aspect ratios. (You can define images with non-square pixels using xres, yres, aspectx, aspecty where xres/yres != aspectx/aspecty.)\n\n useinput - Uses the input's aspect ratio. resolution - Uses the aspect of the image's defined resolution (ie 512x256 would be 2:1), whereby each pixel is square. custom - Lets you explicitly define a custom aspect ratio in the Aspect parameter below.\n\n  aspect -  - Use when Output Aspect parameter is set to Custom Aspect.\n\n aspect1 - aspect2 -\n\n  armenu - A drop-down menu with some commonly used aspect ratios.\n\n\n\n  inputfiltertype -  - This controls pixel filtering on the input image of the .\n\n nearest - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation. Images will look jaggy when viewing at any zoom level other than Native . linear - Uses linear filtering between pixels. This is how you get  images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native . mipmap - Uses  mipmap filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail.\n\n  fillmode -  - Determine how the  image is displayed in the viewer.\nNOTE:To get an understanding of how TOPs work with images, you will want to set this to Native  as you lay down TOPs when starting out. This will let you see what is actually happening without any automatic viewer resizing.\n\n\n useinput - Uses the same Fill Viewer settings as it's input. fill - Stretches the image to fit the edges of the viewer. width - Stretches image to fit viewer horizontally. height - Stretches image to fit viewer vertically. best - Stretches or squashes image so no part of image is cropped. outside - Stretches or squashes image so image fills viewer while constraining it's proportions. This often leads to part of image getting cropped by viewer. nativeres - Displays the native resolution of the image in the viewer.\n\n  filtertype -  - This controls pixel filtering in the viewers.\n\n nearest - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation. Images will look jaggy when viewing at any zoom level other than Native . linear - Uses linear filtering between pixels. Use this to get  images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native . mipmap - Uses  mipmap filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail.\n\n  npasses - Duplicates the operation of the  the specified number of times. Making this larger than 1 is essentially the same as taking the output from each pass, and passing it into the first input of the node and repeating the process. Other inputs and parameters remain the same for each pass.\n\n\n\n  chanmask - Allows you to choose which channels (R, G, B, or A) the  will operate on. All channels are selected by default.\n\n\n\n  format -  - Format used to store data for each channel in the image (ie. R, G, B, and A). Refer to Pixel Formats for more information.\n\n useinput - Uses the input's pixel format. rgba8fixed - Uses 8-bit integer values for each channel. srgba8fixed - Uses 8-bit integer values for each channel and stores color in sRGB colorspace. rgba16float - Uses 16-bits per color channel, 64-bits per pixel. rgba32float - Uses 32-bits per color channel, 128-bits per pixels. rgb10a2fixed - Uses 10-bits per color channel and 2-bits for alpha, 32-bits total per pixel. rgba16fixed - Uses 16-bits per color channel, 64-bits total per pixel. rgba11float - A RGB floating point format that has 11 bits for the Red and Green channels, and 10-bits for the Blue , 32-bits total per pixel (therefore the same memory usage as 8-bit RGBA).
