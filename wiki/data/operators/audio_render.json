The Audio Render  takes a mono sound audio source as input, and spatially outputs the sound in the format specified from the Output Format parameter. The number of channels outputted by the Audio Render  depends on the Output Format. \nYou specify a 3D component for the transform of the listener, plus a 3D component for the transform of a source.\nThe sample rate of the output is determined by the audio source, which must be either 44100 or 48000.\nLook at the Audio Render  example in Help -> Operator .\nSee also Oculus Audio CHOP.\naudiorenderCHOP_Class\n\nContents\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n  active - Turns the Audio Render on or off.\n\n\n\n  listenerobject - A  that represents the listener.

Must be a  that contains transform data, such as a Geometry or Camera .\n\n\n\n  outputformat -  - The output format of the audio: Binaural, Stereo, Quadraphonic Surround, 5.1 Surround, 7.1 Surround, Custom Setup, or Ambisonics (AmbiX). Ambisonics is a format for encoding three-dimensional 360 degree audio. The Ambisonics format used in the Audio Render  is the 3rd order SN3D format consisting of 16 encoded channels (WXYZ, RSTUV, KLMNOPQ) that define the sphere of sound. Custom Setup requires use of the Mapping Table.\n\n Binaural - stereo - quadraphonic - fiveone - sevenone - custom - ambix -\n\n  attenuation - Attenuate the sound based on relative distance.\n\n\n\n  mappingtable - A  Table that specifies the various speakers in the setup and their position. The Table must have 3 columns named x, y, z. Each row specifies an individual speaker, and the 3 columns specify its position. Used with the Custom Setup Output Format. The mapping table will create one channel per row.\n\n\n\n\n\n  timeslice - Turning this on forces the channels to be \"Time Sliced\".

The output of each exporting CHOP is one or more channels, active only while the CHOP Viewer is on.

See Parameter.\n\n\n\nThe location of an operator within the TouchDesigner environment, for example, /geo1/circle1, a node called circle1 in a component called geo1. The path / is called Root.

To refer instead to a filesystem folder, directory, disk file or http: address, see Folder.\n\n\n\nEvery operator in TouchDesigner has a set of control Parameters that can be integer or floating point numbers, menus, binary toggles, text strings or operator paths, which determine the output of the operator.\n\n\n\nTouchDesigner is a hierarchy of components. \"root\" is the top-most network in the hierarchy. The Network Path or Path for root is simply /. A typical path is /project1/moviein1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Audio_Render_CHOP&oldid=29680\"\n\t\tCategory: CHOPs",

In CHOPs it is the set of short channels that contain the CHOP channels' samples between the last and the current cook frame.\n\n\n\nA parameter in most CHOPs that restricts which channels of that CHOP will be affected. Normally all channels of a CHOP are affected by the operator. TOPs have Channel Mask, a similar feature.\n\n\n\nsamples-per-second of a CHOP. Each CHOP in your network has a sample rate. In contrast, the overall timeline has a Frame Rate, which is the number of frames to cook and display per second, generally your monitor display frequency, default 60.\n\n\n\nExporting is the connection of CHOP channels to parameters of operators. The output of each exporting CHOP is one or more channels, active only while the CHOP Viewer is on. The current value of a channel can be exported to a parameter of any operator, overriding that parameter's value. See Parameter.\n\n\n\nThe location of an operator within the TouchDesigner environment, for example, /geo1/circle1, a node called circle1 in a component called geo1. The path / is called Root. This path is displayed at the top of every Pane, showing which Component's network you are currently in. To refer instead to a filesystem folder, directory, disk file or http: address, see Folder.\n\n\n\nEvery operator in TouchDesigner has a set of control Parameters that can be integer or floating point numbers, menus, binary toggles, text strings or operator paths, which determine the output of the operator.\n\n\n\nTouchDesigner is a hierarchy of components. \"root\" is the top-most network in the hierarchy. The Network Path or Path for root is simply /. A typical path is /project1/moviein1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Audio_Render_CHOP&oldid=29680\"",
