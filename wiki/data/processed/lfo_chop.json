      "description": "From Derivative\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tJump to navigation\n\t\tJump to search\n\t\t\nThe LFO  (low frequency oscillator) generates waves in real-time in two ways. It synthesizes curves using a choice of common waveforms like Sine or , or it repeats a prepared incoming curve.\t\t\nIt steps through the waveform at a rate that depends on the Frequency parameter and the Octave Control input. To watch its behavior, attach a Trail  to its output and alter the Frequency parameter.\t\t\t\nUp to three input CHOPs can be connected to the LFO :\t\t\t\nOctave Control - Without this first (optional) input, the frequency is simply the Frequency parameter. If this input is connected, every unit doubles the frequency: When Octave Control is 1, the frequency is double, when it is 2 it is 4x, when it is -1 the frequency is half the Frequency parameter and when it is 0, there is no change in the frequency.\t\t\t\nReset - The seond (optional) input contains on-off (<=0 or >0) that restarts the channels of the oscillator from the beginning of the wave. The reset depends on the setting of the Reset Condition menu. By default, when the Reset input goes from off to on, it resets the wave and starts the waveform immediately. If Reset Condition is set to \"While On\", the reset value will be held until the Reset input goes off. Reset means \"stop the oscillator and cue it at the start of the waveform\".\t\t\t\nSource Wave - The third (optional) input is a replacement of the waveform Type. It is a multi-sample  curve and can contain any number of channels, limited to the channels defined on the Channel page. The waveform Type parameter is disabled.\t\t\t\nThe LFO  can serve as a general motion time-warper and repeater. If you alter the Frequency, you can control the time warp.\t\t\t\nUnlike the Wave CHOP, this is a time-sliced , that is, it generates its waveform as it goes, and speeds/slows how it steps through the waveform Type while the Frequency changes.  Unlike the Audio Oscillator CHOP, the LFO  is designed for non-audio frequencies. \t\t\t\nSee also: Audio Oscillator CHOP, Wave CHOP, Pulse CHOP.\nlfoCHOP_Class\n\nContents\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n  wavetype -  - The shape of the waveform to repeat, unless overridden by the Source Wave:\n\n sin - (-1 to 1) A Sine wave. normal - (0 to 1) A Gaussian (also known as a bell or normal) curve. tri - (-1 to 1) A ramp-up to 1 and ramp-down to -1 that can be shaped with the Bias parameter. ramp - (0 to 1) A ramp from 0 to 1. square - (-1 to 1) Step-up/step-down, with Bias control to make it rectangular. pulse - Produces a 1 for one sample, 0 otherwise.\n\t\t\n  play - The LFO oscillates when 1, and stops when 0.

Unlike the Audio Oscillator CHOP, the LFO  is designed for non-audio frequencies. \t\t\t\nSee also: Audio Oscillator CHOP, Wave CHOP, Pulse CHOP.\nlfoCHOP_Class\n\nContents\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n  wavetype -  - The shape of the waveform to repeat, unless overridden by the Source Wave:\n\n sin - (-1 to 1) A Sine wave. normal - (0 to 1) A Gaussian (also known as a bell or normal) curve. tri - (-1 to 1) A ramp-up to 1 and ramp-down to -1 that can be shaped with the Bias parameter. ramp - (0 to 1) A ramp from 0 to 1. square - (-1 to 1) Step-up/step-down, with Bias control to make it rectangular. pulse - Produces a 1 for one sample, 0 otherwise.\n\t\t\n  play - The LFO oscillates when 1, and stops when 0. Think of it like play and pause.\n\n\n\t\t\n  frequency - The cycles per second of the oscillation. When the Octave Control input is connected, it alters the frequency exponentially.\n\n\n\t\t\n  offset - Values output from the  can have an offset added to them.\n\n\n\t\t\n  amp - Values output from the  can be scaled.\n\n\n\t\t\n  bias - Shape control for Triangle, Gaussian and Square waves. For triangle waves, it moves the peak. For square waves, it alters the width of the peak. Zero means no bias.\n\n\n\t\t\n  phase - A value of .5 is a phase shift of 180 degrees, or one half cycle.\n\n\n\t\t\n  resetcondition -  - This menu determines how the Reset input triggers resetting the channel(s).\n\n offtoon - Channels are reset when the Reset input goes off to on. on - Channels are reset when the Reset input goes on. The channel will hold the reset value until the input turns off. ontooff - Channels are reset when the Reset input goes on to off. off - Channels are reset when the Reset input goes off. The channel will hold the reset value until the input turns on.\n\t\t\n  reset - This toggle resets the channel(s) to 0 while On.\n\n\n\t\t\n  resetpulse - This button instantly resets the channel(s) to 0.\n\n\n\n\n\n  channelname - A list of the names of the channels. You can put patterns like chan[1-10] to generate 10 channels. See Pattern Expansion.\t\nEach channel can be different by putting the channel index variable, $C in parameters like the frequency channel.\n\n\n\t\t\n  rate - The sample rate of the . The default sample rate is 60 samples per second.\n\n\n\n\n\n  timeslice - Turning this on forces the channels to be \"Time Sliced\".  A  is the time between the last cook frame and the current cook frame.\n\n\n\n  scope - To determine which channels get affected, some CHOPs use a  string on the Common page.\n\n\n\n  srselect -  - Handle cases where multiple input CHOPs' sample rates are different. When Resampling occurs, the curves are interpolated according to the Interpolation Method Option, or \"Linear\" if the Interpolate Options are not available.\n\n first - Use rate of first input to resample others. max - Resample to the highest sample rate. min - Resample to the lowest sample rate. err - Doesn't accept conflicting sample rates.\n\n  exportmethod -  - This will determine how to connect the  channel to the parameter. Refer to the Export article for more information.\n\n datindex - Uses the docked  table and references the channel via the index of the channel in the . datname - Uses the docked  table and references the channel via the name of the channel in the . autoname - The channel is the full destination of where to export to, such has geo1/transform1:tx.\n\n  autoexportroot - This path points to the root node where all of the paths that exporting by Channel Name is : are relative to.\n\n\n\n  exporttable - The  used to hold the export information when using the  Table  Methods (See above).\n\n\n\n\n\n -\n -\n -\n\nExtra Information for the LFO  can be accessed via an Info CHOP.\n\n\n\n - Start of the  interval in samples. - Number of samples in the . - The samplerate of the channels in frames per second. - Number of channels in the . - 1 if  is  enabled, 0 otherwise. - A count of how often the export connections have been updated.\n - Number of times the operator has cooked since the process started. - Duration of the last cook in milliseconds. - Frame number when this operator was last cooked relative to the component timeline. - Frame number when this operator was last cooked relative to the absolute time. - Time in milliseconds at which the operator started cooking in the frame it was cooked. - Time in milliseconds at which the operator finished cooking in the frame it was cooked. - 1 if operator was cooked this frame. - Number of warnings in this operator if any. - Number of errors in this operator if any.\nTouchDesigner Build: Latest\\n2021.100002018.28070before 2018.28070\nCHOPs\n• • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • \n\nAn Operator Family which operate on Channels (a sequence of numbers (Samples)) which are used for animation, audio, mathematics, simulation, logic, UI construction, and data streamed from/to devices and protocols.\n\n\n\nTo \"pulse\" a parameter is to send it a signal from (1) an exported CHOP channel or (2) a python command or (3) a mouse click that causes a new action to occur immediately. A pulse via python is via the .pulse() function on a pulse-type parameter, such as Reset parameter in a Speed CHOP. A pulse from a CHOP is typically a 0 to 1 to 0 signal in an exported channel.\n\n\n\nsamples-per-second of a CHOP. Each CHOP in your network has a sample rate. In contrast, the overall timeline has a Frame Rate, which is the number of frames to cook and display per second, generally your monitor display frequency, default 60.\n\n\n\nA Time Slice is the time from the last cook frame to the current cook frame. In CHOPs it is the set of short channels that contain the CHOP channels' samples between the last and the current cook frame.\n\n\n\nA parameter in most CHOPs that restricts which channels of that CHOP will be affected. Normally all channels of a CHOP are affected by the operator. TOPs have Channel Mask, a similar feature.\n\n\n\nExporting is the connection of CHOP channels to parameters of operators. The output of each exporting CHOP is one or more channels, active only while the CHOP Viewer is on. The current value of a channel can be exported to a parameter of any operator, overriding that parameter's value. See Parameter.\n\n\n\nAn Operator Family that manipulates text strings: multi-line text or tables. Multi-line text is often a python Script or GLSL Shader, but can be any multi-line text. Tables are rows and columns of cells, each containing a text string.\n\n\n\nThe location of an operator within the TouchDesigner environment, for example, /geo1/circle1, a node called circle1 in a component called geo1. The path / is called Root. This path is displayed at the top of every Pane, showing which Component's network you are currently in. To refer instead to a filesystem folder, directory, disk file or http: address, see Folder.\n\n\n\nEvery operator in TouchDesigner has a set of control Parameters that can be integer or floating point numbers, menus, binary toggles, text strings or operator paths, which determine the output of the operator.\n\n\n\nTouchDesigner is a hierarchy of components. \"root\" is the top-most network in the hierarchy. The Network Path or Path for root is simply /. A typical path is /project1/moviein1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=LFO_CHOP&oldid=24052\"",
