You can use an IP address (e.g. 100.123.45.78) or the computer's network name can be used directly. If you put \"localhost\", it means the other end of the pipe is on the same computer. When using Multicast mode this should still be set to the server's address, not the multicast address. The server will negotiate the multicast address with the client and make it connect to it automatically.\n\n\n\t\t\n  localaddress - In cases where your computer has multiple network cards and IP address, this tells the node which local IP address to bind to for it's communication. For example say you have a WIFI connection whose IP address is 192.168.0.100 and a ethernet connection whose IP address is 24.100.200.50. If you want the node to communicate over the WIFI you can put 192.168.0.100 or 192.168.0.* into this parameter. If you want the node to communicate via the ethernet you'd set this to 24.100.200.50 or 24.100.200.* (or even 24.100.*.* etc.).

Tables are rows and columns of cells, each containing a text string.\n\n\n\nThe location of an operator within the TouchDesigner environment, for example, /geo1/circle1, a node called circle1 in a component called geo1. The path / is called Root. This path is displayed at the top of every Pane, showing which Component's network you are currently in. To refer instead to a filesystem folder, directory, disk file or http: address, see Folder.\n\n\n\nEvery operator in TouchDesigner has a set of control Parameters that can be integer or floating point numbers, menus, binary toggles, text strings or operator paths, which determine the output of the operator.\n\n\n\nTouchDesigner is a hierarchy of components. \"root\" is the top-most network in the hierarchy. The Network Path or Path for root is simply /. A typical path is /project1/moviein1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=OptiTrack_In_CHOP&oldid=32210\"",
