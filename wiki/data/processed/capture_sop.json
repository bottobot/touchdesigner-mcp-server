Any capture regions that are in this second input are processed after the capture regions that are in the object hierarchy specified by the  parameter. You can also specify a second input and not specify a Parent Object at all.\ncaptureSOP_Class\n\nContents\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n  group - Specify the point groups from the first input (input0) to operate on.\n\n\n\n  rootbone - An object hierarchy is traversed to find the Capture Regions with which to do the weighting. This parameter specifies the top of the traversal hierarchy.\n\n\n\t\t\n  weightfrom -  - Use this menu to specify where to get the weight from.\n\n surface - (default) Uses the surface to compute the weight of a point (or CV in the case of NURBS). This is very helpful for NURBS surfaces when the CV's may be far off the surface. By using , each CV is weight based on the surface's location within a Capture Region. This is determined by calculating the CVs \"most influenced point\" on the NURBS surface and computing the weight of that position. cv - Using the  choice, the location of the point within the region is used for the weighting.\n\t\t\n  captframe - Specifies the frame number to do the capture computations. Every time TouchDesigner reaches this frame, the geometry will be re-captured. It is a common practice to set the  to an frame outside of your animation range, -1 for example. Specifies the frame number to do the capture computations. Every time TouchDesigner reaches this frame, the geometry will be re-captured. It is a common practice to set the  to an frame outside of your animation range, -1 for example.\t\nNote: When a  file is loaded, all of the associated capture regions are evaluated at the . Keyframes must be set to position the capture regions properly at the , otherwise the geometry will be weighted incorrectly upon the subsequent file loads.\n\n\n\t\t\n  color -  - This option colors each point by capture region (using point attributes) according to its capture weight. The points inherit their colors from the Capture Region(s) in which they lie. For example, if a point falls within a blue capture region and also a yellow capture region, the point will be colored green (more blue near if the blue weighting dominates, and more yellow if the yellow weight dominates). In addition, the points become darker as the weighting gets lighter. For example, near the edge of a blue region, a caught point will appear dark blue. Near the centre, it will appear bright blue. If a point is not caught by any region, it is colored bright red.\n\n coldefault - colregion -\n\t\t\n  captfile - The name of the capture override file (*.ocapt). This file is loaded after TouchDesigner completes its point weighting. Each line of the override file lists a point number, a region (path and primitive number) and a weight. The points on the geometry are modified to use these custom weights.\t\nOverride File Format - Each line in the override file must have the following format:\t\t\t\nFor example:\t\t\t\n\n0 /obj/chain_bone1/cregion 0 0.0 \t\t\t\n0 /obj/chain_bone2/cregion 0 3.757989 \t\t\t\n0 /obj/chain_bone3/cregion 0 1.757989\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nThis weights point 0 to three regions (actually only two because the first entry has a weight of zero). Remember that the  is read after TouchDesigner does it's own capture weight computation, so in this case, if point 0 was originally assigned to region /obj/chain_bone4/cregion 0, this part of its weighting would be unchanged.\t\t\t\nThere is no upper limit to the number of regions that can be weighted to a point. If a point/region combination is in the file twice, the second one is used.\t\t\t\nFor example:\t\t\t\n\n0 /obj/chain_bone1/cregion 0 1.0\t\t\t\n0 /obj/chain_bone1/cregion 0 2.0\t\t\t\n\nThis causes the first entry to be ignored (a weighting of 2.0 is used).\t\t\t\nThe weight field is used to prescribe the relative amount of influence a region has on a point. It can be any number. The range of the weights computed by TouchDesigner are specified by the  parameter of each Capture Region (please see Capture Region SOP).\t\t\t\nThe easiest way to a capture  is to use the  button (see below) and start from the file produced by TouchDesigner.\n\n\n\n\n\n  savefile - The file specified here can be used as a \"working file\" to save the point weighting of all the points or a selected subset of points. The file format for the capture override files is fairly straight-forward (see above), so this is a good place to start if you need to do custom overriding.\n\n\n\t\t\n  autoincr - This increments the  name before saving.

Remember that the  is read after TouchDesigner does it's own capture weight computation, so in this case, if point 0 was originally assigned to region /obj/chain_bone4/cregion 0, this part of its weighting would be unchanged.\t\t\t\nThere is no upper limit to the number of regions that can be weighted to a point.

It can be any number.
