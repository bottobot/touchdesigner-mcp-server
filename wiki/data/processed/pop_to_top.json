  "description": "The POP to TOP converts the points of a POP to the pixels of a TOP.  By default it treats the POP points as one unstructured list of points and chooses a square TOP resolution that fits all the points into the image.  It by default converts the P position attribute to pixels in 32-bit float image channels.  The alpha of the image is set to a value of 1, except for the pixels that do not represent any point, where the pixels are set to 0 (the \"active\" channel).",
