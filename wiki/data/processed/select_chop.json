You can select the channels from control panel gadgets like sliders and buttons. It retrieves channels from one or more CHOPs.\t\t\nIt selects only the channels you specify. Example: \"c2 c5 c3 c3\" will result in 4 channels, the last two identical, all in the specified order.\t\t\t\nThere are two ways of getting channels - through the  and Channel Name parameters or directly from a  connected to its input. All extract and renaming options apply when using the  and Channel Name parameters instead of the wired input. \t\t\t\nSee Pattern Matching for selecting CHOPs and channels. \t\t\t\nIt can also rename channels by generating new channel names. See Pattern Replacement and Pattern Expansion for patterns you can use. \t\t\t\nSee Channel Naming Patterns for more ways to manipulate existing channel names into new ones.\t\t\t\n(The Select  gets channels from any , the Parameter CHOP gets parameters of any .)\t\t\t\nSee also the Rename CHOP (Select  does most of the same things and more.)\nselectCHOP_Class\n\nContents\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n  chop - The source(s) of the channels. (Assuming the  is not directly connected).\n\n\n\t\t\n  channames - The names of the channels to keep. Name patterns may be used. Ex:\t\n chan[1-5] *x /project1/geo1:t[xyz]\t\t\t\n\nThe order of the names determine the order of the output channels. If a channel is specified multiple times, it is included in the output multiple times.\n\n\n\t\t\n  renamefrom - The channel pattern to rename. See Pattern Matching.\n\n\n\t\t\n  renameto - The replacement pattern for the names. The default parameters do not rename the channels. See Pattern Replacement.\t\nExample:\t\t\t\n\nChannel Names: c[1-10:2] ambient\nRename From: c* ambient\nRename To: b[1-5] ambThis example fetches channels c1 c3 c5 c7 c9 and ambient.\t\t\t\nThey are then renamed to to b1 b2 b3 b4 b5 and amb.\t\t\t\nSee the Rename CHOP for a further description of rename patterns.\n\n\n\t\t\n  filterbydigits - This toggle enables the two parameters below to select channels with the specified digits at the end of their name. For examples, this can be used to selct all channels with a name ending in the digit \"1\", such as tx1, ty1, tz1, rotate1, etc.\n\n\n \n  digits - Specify the digit at then end of the channel names you want to select when using 'Filter by Digits'\n\n\n \n  stripdigits - Then On, the selected channel names are output without the digits. When Off, the selected channel names are not changed.\n\n\n     \n  align -  - This menu handles cases where multiple input CHOPs have different start or end times. All channels output from a  share the same start/end interval, so the inputs must be treated with the Align Options:\n\n auto - It will trim to the current [] if there are any Time Slices, else it will do an Extend Min/Max. none - Find the earliest start and latest end, and extend all inputs to that range using the extend conditions. (See Extend Conditions). stretch - Find the earliest start and latest end, and stretch every channel's start and end to that range. start - Find the earliest start and shift all channels so they all start at that index. All channels are extended to the length of the longest one. end - Find the latest end and shift all channels so they all end at that index. Extend all channels to the length of the longest one. shift1 - Shift all channels to the start of the first  and sample all inputs using the first input's range. trim1 - Trim all channels to first 's range. stretch1 - Stretch all channels to the first 's range. trim - Trim all channels to the smallest start/end interval. The start and end values may not come from the same channel. squash - Stretch all channels to the smallest start/end interval. The start and end values may not come from the same channel.\n\t\t\n  autoprefix - When 2 channels have the same name, turning on this option will add the node's name (or the node's parent's name, etc.) as a  prefix to the channel name. For example, if selecting a channel from /wave1/chan1 and /wave2/chan1, the channels would be renamed chan1 and chan2 if this option is off. Once turned on the channels would be named wave1:chan1 and wave2:chan1.\n\n\n\n\n\n  timeslice - Turning this on forces the channels to be \"Time Sliced\".  A  is the time between the last cook frame and the current cook frame.\n\n\n\n  scope - To determine which channels get affected, some CHOPs use a  string on the Common page.\n\n\n\n  srselect -  - Handle cases where multiple input CHOPs' sample rates are different. When Resampling occurs, the curves are interpolated according to the Interpolation Method Option, or \"Linear\" if the Interpolate Options are not available.\n\n first - Use rate of first input to resample others. max - Resample to the highest sample rate. min - Resample to the lowest sample rate. err - Doesn't accept conflicting sample rates.\n\n  exportmethod -  - This will determine how to connect the  channel to the parameter. Refer to the Export article for more information.\n\n datindex - Uses the docked  table and references the channel via the index of the channel in the . datname - Uses the docked  table and references the channel via the name of the channel in the . autoname - The channel is the full destination of where to export to, such has geo1/transform1:tx.\n\n  autoexportroot - This path points to the root node where all of the paths that exporting by Channel Name is : are relative to.\n\n\n\n  exporttable - The  used to hold the export information when using the  Table  Methods (See above).\n\n\n\n\n\n -\n\nExtra Information for the Select  can be accessed via an Info CHOP.\n\n\n\n - Start of the  interval in samples. - Number of samples in the . - The samplerate of the channels in frames per second. - Number of channels in the . - 1 if  is  enabled, 0 otherwise. - A count of how often the export connections have been updated.\n - Number of times the operator has cooked since the process started. - Duration of the last cook in milliseconds. - Frame number when this operator was last cooked relative to the component timeline. - Frame number when this operator was last cooked relative to the absolute time. - Time in milliseconds at which the operator started cooking in the frame it was cooked. - Time in milliseconds at which the operator finished cooking in the frame it was cooked. - 1 if operator was cooked this frame. - Number of warnings in this operator if any. - Number of errors in this operator if any.\nTouchDesigner Build: Latest\\n2022.241402021.100002018.28070before 2018.28070\nCHOPs\n• • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • \n\nAn Operator Family which operate on Channels (a sequence of numbers (Samples)) which are used for animation, audio, mathematics, simulation, logic, UI construction, and data streamed from/to devices and protocols.\n\n\n\nAny of the procedural data operators. OPs do all the work in TouchDesigner. They \"cook\" and output data to other OPs, which ultimately result in new images, data and audio being generated. See Node.\n\n\n\nA Time Slice is the time from the last cook frame to the current cook frame. In CHOPs it is the set of short channels that contain the CHOP channels' samples between the last and the current cook frame.\n\n\n\nA parameter in most CHOPs that restricts which channels of that CHOP will be affected. Normally all channels of a CHOP are affected by the operator. TOPs have Channel Mask, a similar feature.\n\n\n\nsamples-per-second of a CHOP. Each CHOP in your network has a sample rate. In contrast, the overall timeline has a Frame Rate, which is the number of frames to cook and display per second, generally your monitor display frequency, default 60.\n\n\n\nExporting is the connection of CHOP channels to parameters of operators. The output of each exporting CHOP is one or more channels, active only while the CHOP Viewer is on. The current value of a channel can be exported to a parameter of any operator, overriding that parameter's value. See Parameter.\n\n\n\nAn Operator Family that manipulates text strings: multi-line text or tables. Multi-line text is often a python Script or GLSL Shader, but can be any multi-line text. Tables are rows and columns of cells, each containing a text string.\n\n\n\nThe location of an operator within the TouchDesigner environment, for example, /geo1/circle1, a node called circle1 in a component called geo1. The path / is called Root. This path is displayed at the top of every Pane, showing which Component's network you are currently in. To refer instead to a filesystem folder, directory, disk file or http: address, see Folder.\n\n\n\nEvery operator in TouchDesigner has a set of control Parameters that can be integer or floating point numbers, menus, binary toggles, text strings or operator paths, which determine the output of the operator.\n\n\n\nTouchDesigner is a hierarchy of components. \"root\" is the top-most network in the hierarchy. The Network Path or Path for root is simply /. A typical path is /project1/moviein1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Select_CHOP&oldid=26786\"\n\t\tCategory: CHOPs",

For examples, this can be used to selct all channels with a name ending in the digit \"1\", such as tx1, ty1, tz1, rotate1, etc.\n\n\n \n  digits - Specify the digit at then end of the channel names you want to select when using 'Filter by Digits'\n\n\n \n  stripdigits - Then On, the selected channel names are output without the digits. When Off, the selected channel names are not changed.\n\n\n     \n  align -  - This menu handles cases where multiple input CHOPs have different start or end times. All channels output from a  share the same start/end interval, so the inputs must be treated with the Align Options:\n\n auto - It will trim to the current [] if there are any Time Slices, else it will do an Extend Min/Max. none - Find the earliest start and latest end, and extend all inputs to that range using the extend conditions. (See Extend Conditions). stretch - Find the earliest start and latest end, and stretch every channel's start and end to that range. start - Find the earliest start and shift all channels so they all start at that index. All channels are extended to the length of the longest one. end - Find the latest end and shift all channels so they all end at that index. Extend all channels to the length of the longest one. shift1 - Shift all channels to the start of the first  and sample all inputs using the first input's range. trim1 - Trim all channels to first 's range. stretch1 - Stretch all channels to the first 's range. trim - Trim all channels to the smallest start/end interval. The start and end values may not come from the same channel. squash - Stretch all channels to the smallest start/end interval. The start and end values may not come from the same channel.\n\t\t\n  autoprefix - When 2 channels have the same name, turning on this option will add the node's name (or the node's parent's name, etc.) as a  prefix to the channel name. For example, if selecting a channel from /wave1/chan1 and /wave2/chan1, the channels would be renamed chan1 and chan2 if this option is off. Once turned on the channels would be named wave1:chan1 and wave2:chan1.\n\n\n\n\n\n  timeslice - Turning this on forces the channels to be \"Time Sliced\".  A  is the time between the last cook frame and the current cook frame.\n\n\n\n  scope - To determine which channels get affected, some CHOPs use a  string on the Common page.\n\n\n\n  srselect -  - Handle cases where multiple input CHOPs' sample rates are different. When Resampling occurs, the curves are interpolated according to the Interpolation Method Option, or \"Linear\" if the Interpolate Options are not available.\n\n first - Use rate of first input to resample others. max - Resample to the highest sample rate. min - Resample to the lowest sample rate. err - Doesn't accept conflicting sample rates.\n\n  exportmethod -  - This will determine how to connect the  channel to the parameter. Refer to the Export article for more information.\n\n datindex - Uses the docked  table and references the channel via the index of the channel in the . datname - Uses the docked  table and references the channel via the name of the channel in the . autoname - The channel is the full destination of where to export to, such has geo1/transform1:tx.\n\n  autoexportroot - This path points to the root node where all of the paths that exporting by Channel Name is : are relative to.\n\n\n\n  exporttable - The  used to hold the export information when using the  Table  Methods (See above).\n\n\n\n\n\n -\n\nExtra Information for the Select  can be accessed via an Info CHOP.\n\n\n\n - Start of the  interval in samples. - Number of samples in the . - The samplerate of the channels in frames per second. - Number of channels in the . - 1 if  is  enabled, 0 otherwise. - A count of how often the export connections have been updated.\n - Number of times the operator has cooked since the process started. - Duration of the last cook in milliseconds. - Frame number when this operator was last cooked relative to the component timeline. - Frame number when this operator was last cooked relative to the absolute time. - Time in milliseconds at which the operator started cooking in the frame it was cooked. - Time in milliseconds at which the operator finished cooking in the frame it was cooked. - 1 if operator was cooked this frame. - Number of warnings in this operator if any. - Number of errors in this operator if any.\nTouchDesigner Build: Latest\\n2022.241402021.100002018.28070before 2018.28070\nCHOPs\n• • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • \n\nAn Operator Family which operate on Channels (a sequence of numbers (Samples)) which are used for animation, audio, mathematics, simulation, logic, UI construction, and data streamed from/to devices and protocols.\n\n\n\nAny of the procedural data operators. OPs do all the work in TouchDesigner. They \"cook\" and output data to other OPs, which ultimately result in new images, data and audio being generated. See Node.\n\n\n\nA Time Slice is the time from the last cook frame to the current cook frame. In CHOPs it is the set of short channels that contain the CHOP channels' samples between the last and the current cook frame.\n\n\n\nA parameter in most CHOPs that restricts which channels of that CHOP will be affected. Normally all channels of a CHOP are affected by the operator. TOPs have Channel Mask, a similar feature.\n\n\n\nsamples-per-second of a CHOP. Each CHOP in your network has a sample rate. In contrast, the overall timeline has a Frame Rate, which is the number of frames to cook and display per second, generally your monitor display frequency, default 60.\n\n\n\nExporting is the connection of CHOP channels to parameters of operators. The output of each exporting CHOP is one or more channels, active only while the CHOP Viewer is on. The current value of a channel can be exported to a parameter of any operator, overriding that parameter's value. See Parameter.\n\n\n\nAn Operator Family that manipulates text strings: multi-line text or tables. Multi-line text is often a python Script or GLSL Shader, but can be any multi-line text. Tables are rows and columns of cells, each containing a text string.\n\n\n\nThe location of an operator within the TouchDesigner environment, for example, /geo1/circle1, a node called circle1 in a component called geo1. The path / is called Root. This path is displayed at the top of every Pane, showing which Component's network you are currently in. To refer instead to a filesystem folder, directory, disk file or http: address, see Folder.\n\n\n\nEvery operator in TouchDesigner has a set of control Parameters that can be integer or floating point numbers, menus, binary toggles, text strings or operator paths, which determine the output of the operator.\n\n\n\nTouchDesigner is a hierarchy of components. \"root\" is the top-most network in the hierarchy. The Network Path or Path for root is simply /. A typical path is /project1/moviein1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Select_CHOP&oldid=26786\"",
