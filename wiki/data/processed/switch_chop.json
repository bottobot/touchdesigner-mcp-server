It selects one of the input CHOPs by index and copies it exactly. This is useful for selecting one of several \"gestures\" or actions. Only one input chop can be selected at a time.\t\nInputs are indexed starting at 0, so that the first input is 0, the second is 1, and so on.\t\t\nIf the First Input Is Index parameter is enabled, the first input is used as the \"switch\" and the remaining inputs will be selection choices. In this case, the second input will be indexed as 0, the third as 1, the fourth as 2, and so on (the Switch input chop is not indexed). The index value is determined by evaluating the first channel in the first input at the current frame. Only integer indices are used; fractional indices will be rounded down to the closest integer.\t\t\nIf the index is less than 0, then the index will be interpreted to be 0.
