It repeats common waveforms (sine, triangle), it generates white noise (a random number for each sample), or it repeats a prepared incoming audio clip of any duration. It outputs typically 44100 samples per second. In contrast, the LFO CHOP by default generates waves at lower frequencies and lower sample rates (60 samples/second), however both Audio Oscillator and LFO are interchangeable by changing their frequencies and sample rates.\t\t\nWhen it is synthesizing tones from the basic waveforms, the Audio Oscillator  steps through the waveform at a rate that depends on the Pitch Control input. By default, a Pitch Control of 0 gives a middle A at 440 Hz; a 1 gives 880 Hz; a -1 gives 220 Hz. Steps of 1 in Pitch Control are 1 octave apart. Steps of 1/12 (.08333) are 1 semitone apart.\t\nThe Audio Oscillator is roughly modelled after the APR 2600 voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO).\nUp to three input CHOPs can be connected to the Audio Oscillator .\t\t\t\nPitch Control - The first (optional) input affects the pitch. Output channels are generated for each Pitch Control channel. When pitch control is 0, it outputs a wave at the base frequency (default 440 Hz at 44,100 samples per second). It is \"logarithmic\": By default, increasing the pitch control by 1 increases the pitch by 1 octave, by 2 it increases by 2 octaves (4 times the frequency).\t\t\t\nReset  - The second (optional) input contains pulses that restart the oscillator from the beginning of the wave or the Playback Source. 0 in the input means \"play the oscillator\". 1 means \"stop the oscillator and cue it at the start of the waveform or Playback Source\".\t\t\t\nPlayback Source - The third (optional) input is a replacement of the waveform Type. It is a sound clip to play at a rate modified by the Pitch Control, and can contain any number of channels. These channels are generated for each Pitch Control channel. The waveform Type and the Base Frequency parameters are disabled.\t\t\t\nIf you plug any sound clip into the Audio Oscillator 's Playback Source, and Pitch Control is a constant value of 0 of any duration, it will just repeat the Playback Source. If you feed a Wave CHOP as its Pitch Control, it will raise and lower the speed/pitch of the input.\t\t\t\nThe Audio Oscillator  can serve as a general motion time-warper and repeater. If you put motion channels into the third input, you can control the time warp by feeding different Pitch Control curves. 0 pitch is normal speed, 1 is double speed.\t\t\t\nUnlike the Wave , this is an iterating , that is, it steps through the waveform while the pitch changes. To see this effect, feed an LFO  into the Audio Oscillator. Unlike the LFO , the Audio Oscillator  is designed for audio frequencies.\t\t\t\nSee also: LFO CHOP, Wave CHOP.\naudiooscillatorCHOP_Class\n\nContents\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n  wavetype -  - The shape of the waveform to repeat, unless overridden by the Playback Source:\n\n sin - (-1 to 1) normal - (0 to 1) tri - (-1 to 1) ramp - (0 to 1) square - (-1 to 1) pulse - (0 to 1) whitenoise - Random samples between -1 and 1\n\t\t\n  frequency - The cycles per second when the Pitch Control is zero.\n\n\n\t\t\n  octave - Amount that the Pitch Control needs to increase by to raise the pitch by one octave.

It outputs typically 44100 samples per second. In contrast, the LFO CHOP by default generates waves at lower frequencies and lower sample rates (60 samples/second), however both Audio Oscillator and LFO are interchangeable by changing their frequencies and sample rates.\t\t\nWhen it is synthesizing tones from the basic waveforms, the Audio Oscillator  steps through the waveform at a rate that depends on the Pitch Control input. By default, a Pitch Control of 0 gives a middle A at 440 Hz; a 1 gives 880 Hz; a -1 gives 220 Hz. Steps of 1 in Pitch Control are 1 octave apart. Steps of 1/12 (.08333) are 1 semitone apart.\t\nThe Audio Oscillator is roughly modelled after the APR 2600 voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO).\nUp to three input CHOPs can be connected to the Audio Oscillator .\t\t\t\nPitch Control - The first (optional) input affects the pitch. Output channels are generated for each Pitch Control channel. When pitch control is 0, it outputs a wave at the base frequency (default 440 Hz at 44,100 samples per second). It is \"logarithmic\": By default, increasing the pitch control by 1 increases the pitch by 1 octave, by 2 it increases by 2 octaves (4 times the frequency).\t\t\t\nReset  - The second (optional) input contains pulses that restart the oscillator from the beginning of the wave or the Playback Source. 0 in the input means \"play the oscillator\". 1 means \"stop the oscillator and cue it at the start of the waveform or Playback Source\".\t\t\t\nPlayback Source - The third (optional) input is a replacement of the waveform Type. It is a sound clip to play at a rate modified by the Pitch Control, and can contain any number of channels. These channels are generated for each Pitch Control channel. The waveform Type and the Base Frequency parameters are disabled.\t\t\t\nIf you plug any sound clip into the Audio Oscillator 's Playback Source, and Pitch Control is a constant value of 0 of any duration, it will just repeat the Playback Source. If you feed a Wave CHOP as its Pitch Control, it will raise and lower the speed/pitch of the input.\t\t\t\nThe Audio Oscillator  can serve as a general motion time-warper and repeater. If you put motion channels into the third input, you can control the time warp by feeding different Pitch Control curves. 0 pitch is normal speed, 1 is double speed.\t\t\t\nUnlike the Wave , this is an iterating , that is, it steps through the waveform while the pitch changes. To see this effect, feed an LFO  into the Audio Oscillator. Unlike the LFO , the Audio Oscillator  is designed for audio frequencies.\t\t\t\nSee also: LFO CHOP, Wave CHOP.\naudiooscillatorCHOP_Class\n\nContents\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n  wavetype -  - The shape of the waveform to repeat, unless overridden by the Playback Source:\n\n sin - (-1 to 1) normal - (0 to 1) tri - (-1 to 1) ramp - (0 to 1) square - (-1 to 1) pulse - (0 to 1) whitenoise - Random samples between -1 and 1\n\t\t\n  frequency - The cycles per second when the Pitch Control is zero.\n\n\n\t\t\n  octave - Amount that the Pitch Control needs to increase by to raise the pitch by one octave. The default of 1 means that Pitch Control of 1 raises the pitch by 1 octave. Units per Octave of .08333 means that a Pitch Control of 3 raises the pitch by a factor of 3 x .08333 (three semitones). This is suitable for using MIDI note numbers as pitch control.\n\n\n\t\t\n  offset - Values output from the  can have an offset added to them.\n\n\n\t\t\n  amp - Values output from the  can be scaled.\n\n\n\t\t\n  bias - Shape control for Triangle, Gaussian and Square waves. For triangle waves, it moves the peak. For square waves, it alters the width of the peak. Zero means no bias.\n\n\n\t\t\n  phase - A value of .5 is a phase shift of 180 degrees, or one half cycle.\n\n\n\t\t\n  smooth - If the Pitch Control channel input to the Audio Oscillator  is rising and is running at the Touch default of 60 frames per second, then the pitch will hold for 1/60 second before stepping up for another 1/60 second. This is an audible step. With this option On, the pitch rises for every audio sample, giving perfectly smooth glissando at extra compute cost.\n\n\n\t\t\n  resetcondition -  - This menu determines how the Reset input triggers a reset of the channel(s).\n\n offtoon - Channels are reset when the Reset input goes off to on. on - Channels are reset when the Reset input goes on. The channel will hold the reset value until the input turns off. ontooff - Channels are reset when the Reset input goes on to off. off - Channels are reset when the Reset input goes off. The channel will hold the reset value until the input turns on.\n\t\t\n  reset - This button resets the channel(s) to 0 when On.\n\n\n\t\t\n  resetpulse - Instantly resets the channel(s) to 0.\n\n\n\n\n\n  rate - Set the sample rate of the  in samples per second.\n\n\n\n\n\n  timeslice - Turning this on forces the channels to be \"Time Sliced\".  A  is the time between the last cook frame and the current cook frame.\n\n\n\n  scope - To determine which channels get affected, some CHOPs use a  string on the Common page.\n\n\n\n  srselect -  - Handle cases where multiple input CHOPs' sample rates are different. When Resampling occurs, the curves are interpolated according to the Interpolation Method Option, or \"Linear\" if the Interpolate Options are not available.\n\n first - Use rate of first input to resample others. max - Resample to the highest sample rate. min - Resample to the lowest sample rate. err - Doesn't accept conflicting sample rates.\n\n  exportmethod -  - This will determine how to connect the  channel to the parameter.

A pulse via python is via the .pulse() function on a pulse-type parameter, such as Reset parameter in a Speed CHOP. A pulse from a CHOP is typically a 0 to 1 to 0 signal in an exported channel.\n\n\n\nsamples-per-second of a CHOP. Each CHOP in your network has a sample rate. In contrast, the overall timeline has a Frame Rate, which is the number of frames to cook and display per second, generally your monitor display frequency, default 60.\n\n\n\nA Time Slice is the time from the last cook frame to the current cook frame. In CHOPs it is the set of short channels that contain the CHOP channels' samples between the last and the current cook frame.\n\n\n\nA parameter in most CHOPs that restricts which channels of that CHOP will be affected. Normally all channels of a CHOP are affected by the operator. TOPs have Channel Mask, a similar feature.\n\n\n\nExporting is the connection of CHOP channels to parameters of operators. The output of each exporting CHOP is one or more channels, active only while the CHOP Viewer is on. The current value of a channel can be exported to a parameter of any operator, overriding that parameter's value. See Parameter.\n\n\n\nAn Operator Family that manipulates text strings: multi-line text or tables. Multi-line text is often a python Script or GLSL Shader, but can be any multi-line text. Tables are rows and columns of cells, each containing a text string.\n\n\n\nThe location of an operator within the TouchDesigner environment, for example, /geo1/circle1, a node called circle1 in a component called geo1. The path / is called Root. This path is displayed at the top of every Pane, showing which Component's network you are currently in. To refer instead to a filesystem folder, directory, disk file or http: address, see Folder.\n\n\n\nEvery operator in TouchDesigner has a set of control Parameters that can be integer or floating point numbers, menus, binary toggles, text strings or operator paths, which determine the output of the operator.\n\n\n\nTouchDesigner is a hierarchy of components. \"root\" is the top-most network in the hierarchy. The Network Path or Path for root is simply /. A typical path is /project1/moviein1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Audio_Oscillator_CHOP&oldid=24071\"",
