      "description": "The Delete  removes entire channels and/or individual samples of its input. \t\t\nFor deleting channels, on the Channels page, you can specify which channels to delete by channel name or a channel number range. A second method deletes channels using a value range to select channels whose values are all within a range. The third method deletes constant-valued channels. An option selects whether to delete or retain the matched channels.\t\t\t\nFor deleting individual samples (i.e. no channels are deleted), on the Samples page you can delete, for example, only the samples whose value is below 0, which will shorten the length of the . \t\t\t\nIn CHOPs with two or more channels, one or more \"compare\" channels are used to determine which samples are to be deleted. By default it uses the first channel to compare against. Deleting a sample at a certain index deletes a value for all the channels. If there are 4 channels, red, green, blue, alpha and you specify alpha as the \"compare\" channel, you can delete all the samples with an alpha of 0. If a  is 3 channels with an X,Y,Z position, you can delete all samples where the XYZ length is below a threshold.\t\t\t\nThis is useful, for example, for thinning your data before sending a  to a Geometry component for instancing. \t\t\t\nWhen all the samples are deleted, the  will keep one sample for all channels and will have a length of one sample.

Channels can be Exported to Parameters.\n\n\n\nA Time Slice is the time from the last cook frame to the current cook frame. In CHOPs it is the set of short channels that contain the CHOP channels' samples between the last and the current cook frame.\n\n\n\nA parameter in most CHOPs that restricts which channels of that CHOP will be affected. Normally all channels of a CHOP are affected by the operator. TOPs have Channel Mask, a similar feature.\n\n\n\nsamples-per-second of a CHOP. Each CHOP in your network has a sample rate. In contrast, the overall timeline has a Frame Rate, which is the number of frames to cook and display per second, generally your monitor display frequency, default 60.\n\n\n\nExporting is the connection of CHOP channels to parameters of operators. The output of each exporting CHOP is one or more channels, active only while the CHOP Viewer is on. The current value of a channel can be exported to a parameter of any operator, overriding that parameter's value. See Parameter.\n\n\n\nAn Operator Family that manipulates text strings: multi-line text or tables. Multi-line text is often a python Script or GLSL Shader, but can be any multi-line text. Tables are rows and columns of cells, each containing a text string.\n\n\n\nThe location of an operator within the TouchDesigner environment, for example, /geo1/circle1, a node called circle1 in a component called geo1. The path / is called Root. This path is displayed at the top of every Pane, showing which Component's network you are currently in. To refer instead to a filesystem folder, directory, disk file or http: address, see Folder.\n\n\n\nEvery operator in TouchDesigner has a set of control Parameters that can be integer or floating point numbers, menus, binary toggles, text strings or operator paths, which determine the output of the operator.\n\n\n\nTouchDesigner is a hierarchy of components. \"root\" is the top-most network in the hierarchy. The Network Path or Path for root is simply /. A typical path is /project1/moviein1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Delete_CHOP&oldid=24427\"",
