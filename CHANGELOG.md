## [2.6.0] - 2025-01-14

### üîß Critical Fixes
- **FIXED: search_operators tool** - The search functionality that was completely broken is now fully operational
- **FIXED: Empty search results** - Resolved issue where all searches returned zero results despite 629 operators being loaded
- **FIXED: Search indexer** - Removed the broken search indexer that was never properly synchronized with operator data

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture Improvements
- **RENAMED: WikiSystem to OperatorDataManager** - More descriptive naming throughout the entire codebase (20+ files updated)
- **RENAMED: WikiWebServer to DocumentationWebServer** - Clearer component naming
- **REMOVED: Web server functionality** - Eliminated unnecessary web server component for cleaner, focused MCP implementation
- **IMPLEMENTED: Direct search algorithm** - New reliable search that queries operator data directly without index dependency

### üöÄ Performance Enhancements
- **Faster search** - Direct search implementation is more performant than the broken indexer approach
- **Reduced overhead** - Removal of web server reduces memory footprint and startup time
- **Simplified architecture** - Pure MCP server without web dependencies

### üìä Data Verification
- **Confirmed 629 operators** accessible and searchable
- **Verified 553 Python API classes** properly loaded
- **Validated 14 tutorials** fully indexed
- **Checked 3,327+ parameters** documentation complete

### üîÑ Changed
- Search now uses `performDirectSearch()` method as primary search mechanism
- All references to WikiSystem updated to OperatorDataManager
- Server operates as pure MCP implementation without web interface
- Improved error messages for search failures

## Migration Guide

### From v2.5.0 to v2.6.0

This is a critical update that fixes the broken search functionality. No migration steps required, but you should:

1. Update immediately if experiencing search issues
2. Restart your MCP server after updating
3. Clear any cached search results

The architecture changes are internal and won't affect your usage:
- WikiSystem is now OperatorDataManager (internal change)
- Web server has been removed (was not user-facing)
- Search uses direct implementation (transparent to users)

### From v2.4.0 to v2.5.0

No breaking changes. The Python API tools are additive and don't affect existing functionality.

### From v1.x to v2.x

Major architecture change from standalone application to MCP server:

1. Uninstall the old standalone application
2. Install via npm: `npm install -g @bottobot/td-mcp`
3. Configure in VS Code MCP settings
4. Remove old configuration files (no longer needed)
