  "description": "Components (or COMPs) are unique compared to other operator families in that they contain their own networks. To make a new network in your project, create a new Component using the OP Create Menu and select from the COMP tab. Then go inside your new component and start building your network. Component networks can contain operators and/or additional sub-networks (additional components). Sub-networks create a hierarchy of networks that can be navigated (using the network path) and forms the overall hierarchical structure of .toe/.tox files.",
