      "description": "An Actor COMP is analogous to a body (or bodies) in a physics system. An Actor COMP must be used in conjunction with a physics solver: either a Bullet Solver COMP or Nvidia Flex Solver COMP, which in turn is analogous to the world/simulation that the actors/bodies operate in. An Actor COMP can either be static, meaning it is not affected by any forces in the simulation and cannot move (ie. has infinite mass), or it can be dynamic, meaning it is moved by forces and collides with other bodies (either static or dynamic) in the world.\n\nactorCOMP_Class\n\nStatic bodies can be concave or convex, but dynamic bodies must be convex. However, dynamic collision shapes can be compound, meaning it is a collision shape made of other collision shapes. So, a concave collision shape can be created in the dynamic case by building it out of a group of convex shapes. This can be done using multiple SOPs. Each SOP must be convex, but combination of the SOPs does not need to be. If Automatic mode is selected, then a compound collision shape will be created from these SOPs.\n\nAll bodies in an Actor COMP have a corresponding collision shape. The collision shape is what determines how objects will collide with one another, and it is important to note that what is seen in the viewer/render will not necessarily directly match the collision shape.\n\nCollision shapes are created using SOPs, either through the \"Collision SOPs\" parameter or by putting them inside the Actor COMP itself. If the \"Collision SOPs\" parameter is filled in, then the Actor COMP will create a single body from all the SOPs at that given paths (if the path is a COMP then it will recursively grab all the SOPs in the COMP). If there is nothing filled in for the \"Collision SOPs\" parameter, then the Actor COMP will instead recursively search inside itself for any SOPs that have both their display and render flags on. The Actor COMP will create a single body and corresponding collision shape from these SOPs.\n\nThere are several options when it comes to creating a collision shape out of the SOPs. These options can be chosen from the \"Collision Shape\" parameter. For instance, the option \"Oriented Bounding Box\" will create a minimum volume bounding box around the selected SOPs.\n\nTo create multiple bodies, use the instancing on the \"Instance\" page of the Actor COMP. This will create any number of identical bodies, each with their own identical collision shape. Currently there is no way to create multiple non-identical bodies in a single Actor COMP.\n\nBodies are initialized using the \"Initialize Actor\" parameter, so if any changes are made to the SOPs that create the bodies, then the Actor COMP must be reinitialized. Bodies will automatically be re-initialized if the Kinematic State, Shape, or Center of Mass is changed.\n\nTransforms can be applied to an Actor COMP using the Xform and Pre-Xform pages, much like on a Geometry COMP or Camera COMP. The transforms on the Xform and Pre-Xform pages create the initial transform of the actor in the simulation, but they can also be used to modify the transform of an actor during a simulation. Changing scale on either page will require a reinitialization of the actor since it changes the collision shape itself. Modifying any of the transforms while instancing will automatically reinitialize the actor.\n\nActor COMPs cannot be nested; however, Actor COMPs can be nested inside Geometry COMPs and vice versa. Geometry COMPs with a nested Actor COMPs cannot have any scale transform; however, Geometry COMPs nested inside an Actor COMP can have scale. An Actor COMP nested inside Geometry COMPs will use their transform only when it is initialized. Therefore, any changes to the transform of these Geometry COMPs will require a reinitialization of the Actor COMP.\n\nFlex actors can either be fluid particles, a fluid particle emitter, or a static shape.\n\nStatic shapes in Flex are built in the same way that concave (ie. static) shapes are built in Bullet. Static shapes require a triangle mesh SOP to build up their collision shape. However, box/sphere collision shape options can also be used to create a bounding box/sphere of the collision shape SOP.\n\nFluid particles behave much the same way as instancing on a Bullet actor. The number of fluid particles is equal to the number of instances created from an instance OP. The instance parameters are used to give the particle an initial transform, but once the simulation is running the transform is updated from the simulation results.\n\nOne key difference of a fluid particle Actor COMP is that no SOP is needed to create a fluid particle since their size/behaviour is defined through the simulation parameters on the Nvidia Flex Solver COMP. A SOP in the Actor COMP can be used to the render/display the positions of the particles. Alternatively, the particle positions can be fetched using the Nvidia Flex TOP.\n\nFluid emitters add particles to the scene at the emission point (ie. the transform of the Actor COMP). Particles are added up until the emission maximum is reached, at which point emission particles will be recycled from already existing particles.\n\nWhen creating an Actor COMP there are some important questions to consider:\n\nTo understand why two bodies might not collide it is important to understand that Bullet simulates discretely. Speed, position, constraints, collisions are all calculated on a frame by frame basis, as opposed to continuously. In the case of Bullet, collisions are calculated at the beginning and the end of a frame. What this means is that if a body is moving a large distance every frame it can clip through other bodies, because it's not colliding with it at the beginning or the end of the frame when collision is calculated. In the same vein, if an object is very thin then other bodies will be able to clip through it easier than something with more depth because bodies won't have to move as far in a frame to completely jump over it.\n\nContinuous collision detection (see parameter) helps to fix this by performing collision detection along the movement vector (between start/end of frame) so that collisions happening between the start/end of frame will be caught. This helps significantly with high linear velocity bodies, but not so much high angular velocity bodies.\n\nA couple other things to consider changing to fix body \"leaking\":\n\nThe Xform parameter page controls the object component's transform in world space.\n\nThe Pre-Xform parameter page applies a transform to the object component the same way connecting another Object as a parent of this node does. The transform is applied to the left of the Xform page's parameters. In terms of matrix math, if we use the 'multiply on the right' (column vector) convention, the equation would be preXForm * xform * Position.\n\nThe Instance parameter page provides the ability to create hardware instances of geometry. Each instance has an instance ID which can be passed into a MAT shader via a uniform value. The instance ID can be retrieved by the Render Pick CHOP. Any code in a vertex shader can customize the instance based on the instance ID.\n\nInstance's attributes can be individually driven by the data from any type of OP. When the instance data is supplied by a TOP, the TOP's RGBA channels are assigned to instance attributes, when data is supplied by a CHOP, the CHOP's channels are assigned to instance attributes, when from a SOP then the SOP's attributes are assigned to instance attributes, and when a DAT is used then a column is assigned to the instances attributes. The mapping of operator data to instance attributes is setup on the parameters below and on the Instance 2 and Instance 3 parameter pages.\n\nWhen the instance data is supplied by a TOP, the TOP's RGBA channels are assigned to instance attributes; when data is supplied by a CHOP, the CHOP's channels are assigned to instance attributes; when from a SOP then the SOP's attributes are assigned to instance attributes; and when a DAT is used then a column is assigned to the instances attributes.\n\nThis feature allows for arbitrary textures to be applied to instances. The textures do not need to be the same resolution, and they don't need to be combined into an grouped format such as a 3D Texture or a 2D Texture array. Multiple TOPs can be specified using the \"Instance Textures\" parameter, and the texture that is applied per-instance is specified using the channel chosen in the \"Texture Index\" parameter. This is different from a 3D Texture or 2D Texture Array, which would use the W texture coordinate to select a texture from within a single texture. By default this texture will be used as the \"Base Color Map\" texture for a PBR MAT, and the Color Map for all other materials such as the Phong MAT. For materials that support more than one map, the map that this this feature replaces can be chosen in the material's parameters. Currently on Windows at most 16384 textures can be used at once, and on macOS at most 128 textures can be used at once. These numbers are reduced by other textures that are used by the render such as other maps, cone light lookup map etc.\n\nCustom attributes allow arbitrary attributes to be assigned to instances, usable in a GLSL MAT. They can be accessed using TDInstanceCustomAttrib0(), TDInstanceCustomAttrib1() etc. For more information refer to Write a GLSL Material. These attributes will be ignored in other materials such as the PBR MAT.\n\nBelow you can add more parameters as you require more custom attributes. Different GPUs will have a different number of maximum custom attributes supported.\n\nThe Display parameter page controls the component's material and rendering settings.\n\nThe Extensions parameter page sets the component's python extensions.  Please see extensions for more information.\n\nThe Common parameter page sets the component's node viewer and clone relationships.\n\nExtra Information for the Actor COMP can be accessed via an Info CHOP.\n\nTouchDesigner Build: Latest\\nwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditormw-undo2022.241402021.100002020.236802020.200002019.146502018.28070",

Then Parent the Camera to the newly created Null Component, and tell the camera to look at this Component using the Look At parameter. You can direct the attention of the camera by moving the Null Component with the Select state. If you want to see both the camera and the Null Component, enable the Null Component's display flag, and use the Select state in an additional Viewport by clicking one of the icons in the top-right corner of the TouchDesigner window."

The component contains a pre-defined network utilizing a Keyframe CHOP and a number of Table DATs to define the animated CHOP channels.\n\nThe Animation Editor is the user interface for creating and editing the animation of the Animation Component.\n\nThe Animation Component has both in and out CHOP connectors.\n\nAnimation Component Inputs\n\nWith no input connected, the Animation Component's index loops over the time range of the channels. \t\t\t\nThe CHOP input can be used to manually control the index of the animated channels. For example, if the channels are keyed from frame 1 to 600, you can connect an input to the component and manually drive the animation output by feeding it a number between 1 and 600 (indexes outside the range will use the channel extend conditions).\n\nUsing the Keyframe CHOP's Index Units menu, you can drive the animation with numbers expressed in seconds, samples, or a fraction where 0 is the start and 1 is the end.\n\nAnimation Component Outputs\n\nThe CHOP output gives access to the animation channel's current value. CHOPs can be directly connected or a Null CHOP may be appended for exporting the channels to parameters. The current channel values can also be viewed by turning on the Animation Component's node viewer.\n\nanimationCOMP_Class\n\nKeyframing any parameter, attribute, or data in TouchDesigner begins with an Animation Component. You can create an Animation COMP from;\n\nTo open the Animation Editor, right-click on an Animation COMP and select Edit Animation... to open that animation in the editor.  You can also change any pane to Animation Editor type and the Editor will open whilst pointing to the last Animation COMP that was scoped.\n\nThen you can create and keyframe animation channels. Refer to the Animation Editor for instructions on keyframing.\n\nThe Extensions parameter page sets the component's python extensions.  Please see extensions for more information.\n\nThe Common parameter page sets the component's node viewer and clone relationships.\n\nExtra Information for the Animation COMP can be accessed via an Info CHOP.\n\nTouchDesigner Build: Latest\\nwikieditorwikieditorwikieditor2022.241402021.100002018.28070before 2018.28070",

      "description": "Annotates are displayed in the Network Editor as colored rectangles containing user-authored text and graphics. It is based on the Annotate COMP and allows you to document your networks with useful information like comments and node grouping.\n\nThere are three built-in forms of the Annotate COMP:  Comments, Network Boxes, and Annotates that can be easily created:\n\nannotateCOMP_Class\n\nThe default setup of Annotate COMPs is a full-featured comment, network box, and node viewer, designed to be a flexible network organization and documentation tool. The following features are built using internal nodes and an extension and are not inherent parts of the Annotate COMP itself.\n\nThe lock icon in the top-right of the box locks and unlocks text editing in the Annotate. In a locked Annotate, you cannot edit text and clicking on the body area clicks through to the network below. Annotates also have a RMB menu for quick access to many features. It is always accessible through the title bar, and accessible through the body when the Annotate is unlocked.\n\nYou can size Annotates by dragging the edges and move them by dragging the title bar. In Comment mode, which has no title bar, you can drag the Annotate by the text body. When the Enclose OPs feature is on, dragging an Annotate will drag all enclosed nodes (including other Annotates) with it. To drag an annotate without dragging its contents, you can hold down Alt while dragging.\n\nAnnotates have powerful built-in Operator Viewer features, including positioning and interaction, which can be controlled using Parameters - OP Viewer Page. For basic text features see Parameters - Text Page. For deeper text editing and color features including limiting text width, wrapping, and more, see Parameters - Settings Page.\n\nAnnotates are layered in the network so that smaller boxes are in front of larger boxes, but you have more control with the Depth Layer parameter. Annotates are positioned behind the grid by default, but you can put them in front of the grid, or even on top of the nodes tiles. For example, put an image with transparency in the Viewer OP and turn Back Color Alpha to 0, then set Layer Zone to be Above Nodes.\n\nBecause the Enter shortcut and zoom-to-enter are disabled in Annotates, to get inside an Annotate, use one of the following methods:\n\nYou can switch between the three built-in Annotate modes by using the Mode parameter of the Annotate COMP or the Mode menu in the right-click menu.\n\nBasic text features including editable/searchable parameters holding the Annotate's text.\n\nMore advanced text control and color parameters.\n\nControls for the embedded Operator viewer.\n\nBodyColor → [R, G, B, A] (Read Only):\n\nBodyFontColor → [R, G, B, A] (Read Only):\n\nBodySelectColor → [R, G, B, A] (Read Only):\n\nBodyText →  :\n\nColor → [R, G, B] (Read Only):\n\nEncloseOPs → bool :\n\nTitleColor → [R, G, B, A] (Read Only):\n\nTitleFontColor → [R, G, B, A] (Read Only):\n\nTitleSelectColor → [R, G, B, A] (Read Only):\n\nTitleText →  :\n\nOnCreate(Mode):\n\nThe Extensions parameter page sets the component's python extensions.  Please see extensions for more information.\n\nThe Common parameter page sets the component's node viewer and clone relationships.\n\nExtra Information for the Annotate COMP can be accessed via an Info CHOP.\n\nTouchDesigner Build: Latest\\nwikieditorwikieditor2023.112802022.24140before 2022.24140",

It gives you some extra flexibility in setting up parent-child relationships. It operates like the Switch and Sequence Blend SOPs insofar as it takes more than one input and blends or switches those into one output.\tIt affects the object transform only, not the contents of the blended components.\n\nSome potential uses of the Blend op are to animate parenting, such as when one character passes an item to another, or to pass on only part of a parents characteristics.\n\nNote that the effect of the Blend COMP is only visible through a Camera COMP or the Render TOP that is rendering that camera's view.\n\nblendCOMP_Class\n\nThe Xform parameter page controls the object component's transform in world space.\n\nThe Pre-Xform parameter page applies a transform to the object component the same way connecting another Object as a parent of this node does. The transform is applied to the left of the Xform page's parameters. In terms of matrix math, if we use the 'multiply on the right' (column vector) convention, the equation would be preXForm * xform * Position.\n\nThe Display parameter page controls the component's material and rendering settings.\n\nThe Extensions parameter page sets the component's python extensions.

Then Parent the Camera to the newly created Null Component, and tell the camera to look at this Component using the Look At parameter. You can direct the attention of the camera by moving the Null Component with the Select state. If you want to see both the camera and the Null Component, enable the Null Component's display flag, and use the Select state in an additional Viewport by clicking one of the icons in the top-right corner of the TouchDesigner window."

      "description": "The Bone Component is the foundation of all of the Character Tools. It is a Component with most of the properties of a Geometry Component. It also has some extra features such as length, two types of geometry, end-to-end linking, and kinematic parameters.\n\nThe Bone Component is used to create hierarchies of limb-like objects that form part of a hierarchy or chain of Bone Components that are parented to one another. The movement of the chain of Bone Components is \"solved\" or computed based on several methods including Inverse Kinematics. The parenting attribute of bones is unique in that each bone attaches to the end, not the origin, of the parent bone.\n\nIt is recommended that you use the Bone Creation state, accessed through the state icons above the Viewport, to construct such a chain because placing individual Bone Components and establishing their parenting relationships from operator to operator is extremely time consuming and not at all intuitive. In addition, a chain created using the Bone state will produce a better behaved bone chain.\n\nBy default, bones do not render. They contain two types of display geometry: \"link geometry\" and \"capture region geometry\". The former consists of a narrow diamond shape which has been stretched to the length specified in Bone Length, and placed along the Bone Component's negative Z-axis. The latter consists of two or more user-controllable ellipses that are used to define capture regions used in skeleton sops. You can specify whether either of the two types of geometry are displayed.\n\nThe actual movement of the Bone Components is controlled through an IK CHOP (when using the standard Capture/Deform model). This is effected through an expression in the Transform channels of the Bone Component. If you want to override this behaviour, then you need to delete the bone's translate channels such that they are no longer over-ridden by chop control.\n\nIf you make a bone the child of a non-bone Component, then it will attach to the origin of that Component. If you want to reposition the bone relative to its non-bone parent, you must remove the expression in the bone's translate parameters.\n\nboneCOMP_Class\n\nThe Xform parameter page controls the object component's transform in world space.\n\nThe Pre-Xform parameter page applies a transform to the object component the same way connecting another Object as a parent of this node does. The transform is applied to the left of the Xform page's parameters. In terms of matrix math, if we use the 'multiply on the right' (column vector) convention, the equation would be preXForm * xform * Position.\n\nThe Capture page is used to automatically create a capture region used by either the Capture or Deform sops (see Capture SOP and Deform SOP of the SOPs section). The capture region consists of at least two ellipses, and they may be translated along the bone's length.\n\nRegion Centre / Top Bottom Cap Heights\n\nAll the geometry that is generated by the Bone Component is created using regular SOPs. Therefore, it is customisable by simply changing the Bone Component's SOP network. The bone's display can be easily altered by changing its contained SOPs.\n\nThe Display parameter page controls the component's material and rendering settings.\n\nThe Extensions parameter page sets the component's python extensions.  Please see extensions for more information.\n\nThe Common parameter page sets the component's node viewer and clone relationships.\n\nExtra Information for the Bone COMP can be accessed via an Info CHOP.\n\nTouchDesigner Build: Latest\\nwikieditor2022.241402021.100002018.28070before 2018.28070",

Then Parent the Camera to the newly created Null Component, and tell the camera to look at this Component using the Look At parameter. You can direct the attention of the camera by moving the Null Component with the Select state. If you want to see both the camera and the Null Component, enable the Null Component's display flag, and use the Select state in an additional Viewport by clicking one of the icons in the top-right corner of the TouchDesigner window."

      "description": "In a Bullet Dynamics system, the Bullet Solver COMP is analogous to the world/simulation in which actors/bodies (ie. Actor COMPs) operate. A Bullet Solver COMP contains any number of actors/bodies (Actor COMPs) or forces (Force COMP/Impulse Force COMP), and as the name suggests it also uses the Bullet Physics API to step through the simulation.\n\nThe Bullet Solver COMP runs a Bullet simulation based on some simulation parameters (eg. linear multiplier or angular multiplier) and updates the transformations of the Actor COMPs contained within it as the simulation progresses forward. The simulation can be paused, slowed down, sped up, or restarted using the parameters on the COMP.\n\nThe Bullet Solver COMP simulation operates in a vacuum, so there will be no air resistance applied to any actors in the simulation. The simulation is stepped at the given sample rate, and the Actor COMP transform is updated accordingly. These transformations are the same results displayed in the Bullet Solver CHOP.\n\nThe Actor COMPs referenced by the Bullet Solver COMP do not need to be inside its network. They can be anywhere as long as they are not already referenced by another Bullet Solver COMP.\n\nbulletsolverCOMP_Class\n\nThe Xform parameter page controls the object component's transform in world space.\n\nThe Pre-Xform parameter page applies a transform to the object component the same way connecting another Object as a parent of this node does. The transform is applied to the left of the Xform page's parameters. In terms of matrix math, if we use the 'multiply on the right' (column vector) convention, the equation would be preXForm * xform * Position.\n\nThe Display parameter page controls the component's material and rendering settings.\n\nThe Extensions parameter page sets the component's python extensions.  Please see extensions for more information.\n\nThe Common parameter page sets the component's node viewer and clone relationships.\n\nExtra Information for the Bullet Solver COMP can be accessed via an Info CHOP.\n\nTouchDesigner Build: Latest\\nwikieditormw-blank2022.241402021.100002019.146502018.28070before 2018.28070",

        "If you feedback a Bullet Solver CHOP that has no change to the channel values in it, the simulation will act as normal as nothing is being overriden. This allows you do things like the example below. \nFor example, to negate the velocity of every actor in a simulation you could use a Bullet Solver CHOP, put that into a Switch CHOP with the second input being the same CHOP only with the velocity channels negated. Then export a button pulse to the switch index and put the Switch CHOP into the Feedback CHOP parameter. Then, when the button is pressed for a single frame (pulsed) the velocities will be overridden and negated.  \nThe only channels required to feedback are the actor_id and body_id channels, all other channels are optional. The channel names should all be the same as in the Bullet Solver CHOP. In addition to the channels outputted in the Bullet Solver CHOP, force and torque can also be used. The channel names are force[xyz] and torque[xyz]. NOTE: scale cannot be used for feedback.",
        "Note: Scaling a camera's channels is not generally recommended. However, should you decide to do so, the rendered output will match the Viewport as closely as possible when scales are involved.",
        "Tip: To designate a center of interest for the camera that doesn't appear in your scene, create a Null Component and disable its display flag. Then Parent the Camera to the newly created Null Component, and tell the camera to look at this Component using the Look At parameter. You can direct the attention of the camera by moving the Null Component with the Select state. If you want to see both the camera and the Null Component, enable the Null Component's display flag, and use the Select state in an additional Viewport by clicking one of the icons in the top-right corner of the TouchDesigner window."

Radio and exclusive buttons act as a group, which can be as simple as all Button components in a Container component. The group can be specified more tightly using the Button Group Label parameter or the Button Group DAT parameter.\n\nDefault Button Component\n\nbuttonCOMP_Class\n\nThe Layout parameter page controls the size and position of the panel.\n\nThe Panel parameter page controls panel attributes such as display on/off, enable on/off, panel help, and interactions with the cursor.\n\nThe Color parameter page sets the panel's background, border, and disabled colors.\n\nThe Children parameter page controls aspects of the Panel's children alignment, size, and position.\n\nPlease refer to Drag-and-Drop for a full explanation on how Drag and Drop between Panel Components functions.\n\nThe Extensions parameter page sets the component's python extensions.  Please see extensions for more information.\n\nThe Common parameter page sets the component's node viewer and clone relationships.\n\nExtra Information for the Button COMP can be accessed via an Info CHOP.\n\nTouchDesigner Build: Latest\\nwikieditorwikieditor",

      "description": "The Camera Blend Component blends the 3D object transforms and viewing settings of multiple Camera Components together. It gives you some extra flexibility in setting up parent-child relationships. It operates like the Switch SOP and Sequence Blend SOPs insofar as it takes more than one input and blends or switches those into one output.\n\nThe Camera Blend COMP can animate camera parameters and positions between various cameras.\n\nTo set up, wire the bottom connector of a Camera COMP to the top input of the Camera Blend COMP. Then for another Camera COMP, wire its bottom connector to the top of the Camera Blend COMP. Then you can adjust the Weight parameters of the Camera Blend COMP.\n\nThe View and Background parameter pages are used as the camera parameters when non-Camera COMPs are connected to the Camera Blend COMP.\n\ncamerablendCOMP_Class\n\nThe Xform parameter page controls the object component's transform in world space.\n\nThe Pre-Xform parameter page applies a transform to the object component the same way connecting another Object as a parent of this node does. The transform is applied to the left of the Xform page's parameters. In terms of matrix math, if we use the 'multiply on the right' (column vector) convention, the equation would be preXForm * xform * Position.\n\nThe Display parameter page controls the component's material and rendering settings.\n\nThe Extensions parameter page sets the component's python extensions.  Please see extensions for more information.\n\nThe Common parameter page sets the component's node viewer and clone relationships.\n\nExtra Information for the Camera Blend COMP can be accessed via an Info CHOP.\n\nTouchDesigner Build: Latest\\nwikieditor2022.241402021.100002018.28070before 2018.28070",

Then Parent the Camera to the newly created Null Component, and tell the camera to look at this Component using the Look At parameter. You can direct the attention of the camera by moving the Null Component with the Select state. If you want to see both the camera and the Null Component, enable the Null Component's display flag, and use the Select state in an additional Viewport by clicking one of the icons in the top-right corner of the TouchDesigner window.",

The transform is applied to the left of the Xform page's parameters. In terms of matrix math, if we use the 'multiply on the right' (column vector) convention, the equation would be preXForm * xform * Position.\n\nThe Display parameter page controls the component's material and rendering settings.\n\nThe Extensions parameter page sets the component's python extensions.

Then Parent the Camera to the newly created Null Component, and tell the camera to look at this Component using the Look At parameter. You can direct the attention of the camera by moving the Null Component with the Select state. If you want to see both the camera and the Null Component, enable the Null Component's display flag, and use the Select state in an additional Viewport by clicking one of the icons in the top-right corner of the TouchDesigner window.",

Object Components also have a Bypass Flag and an additional 3 flags in their lower right corner:  the Pickable Flag (orange), the Render Flag (purple), and the Display Flag (blue).\n\nYou can save out a Component into a .tox file with a RMB -> Save Component on the node. This is handy for sharing networks with other TouchDesigner users and projects. Any commonly-used tool or network you create in TouchDesigner is good candidate for a Component.\n\nTo embed other files, like images, into .tox files, see Virtual File System (VFS).\n\nSee Also Category:Components",

These are listed in four separate columns in the OP Create Menu.\n\nObject components can be parented in a hierarchy by connecting them together vertically (using their connectors on the top and bottom of the nodes).\n\nObjectCOMP_Class\n\nPanel components can be parented in a hierarchy by connecting them together vertically (using their connectors on the top and bottom of the nodes).\n\nPanelCOMP_Class\n\nComponents can have operator inputs and outputs on the left/right sides of the node if their network contains In and/or Out operators (of most types: TOP, CHOP, SOP, DAT. e.g. In TOP and Out CHOP).\n\nThese allow operator data to flow in and out of the component's network, allowing a Component to share its internal data with other components, operators, and other parts of your project.  Adding these OPs inside a Component will add alphanumerically-ordered inputs/outputs on the left/right side of the component that data can flow through. Inputs are on Component’s left side, outputs on the right.\n\nAn output preview window is displayed when the cursor is over one of the outputs of a component. MMB on output preview to see info about that output. RMB on output preview brings up OP Create menu.\n\nA noise component has been constructed to take a TOP, CHOP, and SOP input, apply noise to each one,  then output the results. The component's internal network looks like this:\n\nThe image below shows how the inputs and outputs of the Component can be connected into a network.\n\nComponents have the 4 common Flags along their left side: the Viewer Flag, the Clone Immune Flag, the Cooking Flag, and the Lock Flag. Object Components also have a Bypass Flag and an additional 3 flags in their lower right corner:  the Pickable Flag (orange), the Render Flag (purple), and the Display Flag (blue).\n\nYou can save out a Component into a .tox file with a RMB -> Save Component on the node. This is handy for sharing networks with other TouchDesigner users and projects. Any commonly-used tool or network you create in TouchDesigner is good candidate for a Component.\n\nTo embed other files, like images, into .tox files, see Virtual File System (VFS).\n\nSee Also Category:Components",

      "description": "A Constraint COMP is used to restrict the movement of the bodies in a set of Actor COMPs. Currently this can be done in a few ways: point to point, hinge or slider. Constraints can either be applied on a single body or between two bodies. Constraints can be used to create connectivity between bodies, or to create bodies that can move but need to have that movement restricted in some way. Some examples of constraints in the real world: a train, a door, an arm.\n\nIf a point to point constraint is applied to a single body, then that body will be restricted to 3 degrees of freedom (DOF). It will still have all 3 degrees of freedom for rotation (ie. All 3 axes), but the 3 degrees of freedom for translation will all be constrained. If a point to point constraint is applied between two bodies, then they will both be similarly constrained to 3 DOF. However, they will be able to move (translate) along all 3 axes but they will do it connected to each other at their pivot points. By using this constraint method, a chain of bodies can be created. For instance, point to point constraints can be used to simulate train cars connected to each other.\n\nIf a hinge constraint is applied to a single body, then that body will be restricted to 1 DOF relative to the other body. It will only be able to rotate around 1 axis, and that axis is defined using the Axis parameter on the Constraint COMP. Much like the point to point constraint, the hinge also as a pivot point around which it will rotate. If a hinge constraint is applied between two bodies, then they will both be able to move with 3 DOF but they will do it connected to each other at their pivot points. However, they will still only be able to rotate around their respective axis. The simplest example of a hinge constraint is a door.\n\nIf a slider constraint is applied to a single body, then that body's translation/rotation will be constrained to just that axis. In other words, the body can only move along that axis (either direction) and can only rotate along that axis (either direction).\n\nconstraintCOMP_Class\n\nThe Extensions parameter page sets the component's python extensions.  Please see extensions for more information.\n\nThe Common parameter page sets the component's node viewer and clone relationships.\n\nExtra Information for the Constraint COMP can be accessed via an Info CHOP.\n\nTouchDesigner Build: Latest\\nwikieditor2022.241402021.100002019.146502018.28070",

      "category": "COMP",
      "description": "The Engine COMP will run a .tox file (component) in a separate process. It uses TouchEngine to manage these processes and pass data between the loaded component and the main project.\n\nInputs and Outputs\n\nThe chosen component's top-level Inputs and Outputs are exposed as inputs and outputs on the Engine COMP. Only TOP, CHOP and DAT inputs and outputs are supported.\n\nCustom Parameters\n\nAny custom parameters on the top-level component are added to the Engine COMP's parameters. Custom parameters which refer to other nodes in the network, such as TOP, CHOP and DAT parameters, are not supported - you should use inputs to connect those nodes instead.\n\nNote that parameters work in one direction only - you cannot set a parameter from within the loaded .tox.\n\nExternal File Paths\n\nBy default, relative paths on OPs or in scripts inside the loaded component are relative to the .tox file's location. This can be changed with the 'Asset Paths' parameter. Relative paths as file or folder custom parameters of the component - those that show up on the Engine COMP - are always relative to the main project.\n\nMonitoring Engine Status\n\nIt is useful to monitor the state and performance of the Engine COMP. By default, an Info DAT is docked to the Engine COMP and contains file path and process ID. A docked Info CHOP contains three sets of monitoring channels: The Info Type menu is by default set to TouchEngine Status which gives loading / running / error status of the Engine process. Changing the menu to TouchEngine Perform gives the engine's performance statistics, and changing the menu to Initialize/Start give ready / running state information specifically about your loaded component since it can be paused, timed and re-initialized.\n\nControlling Engine State\n\nThe Engine process will be started by the TouchDesigner process and it will run your .tox component automatically. But you can have more control over the time/memory management of multiple components using the Unload, Reload pulse parameters for the currently-loaded .tox file. On the Advanced page, the Launch and Quit Engine Process parameters give you terminate/restart control of the entire Engine process.\n\nComponent Lifetime\n\nUnder TouchEngine, components are loaded into an already-running instance. For this reason, an Execute DAT's onStart() and onExit() method will never be executed under TouchEngine. The onCreate() method will be executed when the component is loaded, and is a good place to do any setup you would normally do in onStart().\n\nTime in TouchEngine\n\nWhen the Engine COMP starts the component (after it has loaded, if 'Start when Initialized' is On), the component time in TouchEngine is 0. It will then increase either in sync with the Engine COMP or according to TouchEngine's internal clock, depending on the setting of the 'Clock' parameter on the Tune parameter page.\n\nAn input buffer and output buffer are used to allow for differences in cook rate between the Engine COMP and TouchEngine. Often you may want to adjust the parameters on the Tune page to suit your particular setup. The Engine COMP will cook frames to fill its input buffer, if required, prior to starting to cook the component in TouchEngine - then will cook frames in TouchEngine to fill its output buffer prior to emitting output from the Engine COMP. The Auto setting will attempt to keep small buffers sufficient to avoid dropped frames, but you may wish to set a fixed buffer size to suit your setup, particularly if working with audio.\n\nTouchEngine Versions\n\nTouchEngine is installed as part of TouchDesigner, and the currently running version will be used to load the given .tox. If you wish to use a different version of TouchEngine you can either set the environment variable TOUCHENGINE_APP_PATH to the path to a TouchDesigner installation (an installation directory on Windows, or a TouchDesigner app on macOS) or install TouchDesigner into a folder named TouchEngine alongside the .tox (on macOS rename an application from TouchDesigner to TouchEngine) or create a link named TouchEngine alongside the .tox which points to an installation directory or TouchDesigner app.\n\nengineCOMP_Class\n\nThe Extensions parameter page sets the component's python extensions.  Please see extensions for more information.\n\nThe Common parameter page sets the component's node viewer and clone relationships.\n\nExtra Information for the Engine COMP can be accessed via an Info CHOP.\n\nTouchDesigner Build: Latest\\nwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditormw-replace2023.112802022.241402021.100002020.200002019.146502018.28070before 2018.28070",

A docked Info CHOP contains three sets of monitoring channels: The Info Type menu is by default set to TouchEngine Status which gives loading / running / error status of the Engine process. Changing the menu to TouchEngine Perform gives the engine's performance statistics, and changing the menu to Initialize/Start give ready / running state information specifically about your loaded component since it can be paused, timed and re-initialized.",
        "The Engine process will be started by the TouchDesigner process and it will run your .tox component automatically.

      "category": "COMP",
      "description": "The Engine COMP will run a .tox file (component) in a separate process. It uses TouchEngine to manage these processes and pass data between the loaded component and the main project.\n\nThe Engine COMP also allows components loaded in the Engine COMP to open a Window COMP (and go into Perform Mode). The Clock Mode must be set Independent (on the Tune page) to enable this - which is required to allow UI events to be serviced.\n\nInputs and Outputs\n\nThe chosen component's top-level Inputs and Outputs are exposed as inputs and outputs on the Engine COMP. Only TOP, CHOP and DAT inputs and outputs are supported.\n\nCustom Parameters\n\nAny custom parameters on the top-level component are added to the Engine COMP's parameters. Custom parameters which refer to other nodes in the network, such as TOP, CHOP and DAT parameters, are not supported - you should use inputs to connect those nodes instead.\n\nNote that parameters work in one direction only - you cannot set a parameter from within the loaded .tox.\n\nExternal File Paths\n\nBy default, relative paths on OPs or in scripts inside the loaded component are relative to the .tox file's location. This can be changed with the 'Asset Paths' parameter. Relative paths as file or folder custom parameters of the component - those that show up on the Engine COMP - are always relative to the main project.\n\nMonitoring Engine Status\n\nIt is useful to monitor the state and performance of the Engine COMP. By default, an Info DAT is docked to the Engine COMP and contains file path and process ID. A docked Info CHOP contains three sets of monitoring channels: The Info Type menu is by default set to TouchEngine Status which gives loading / running / error status of the Engine process. Changing the menu to TouchEngine Perform gives the engine's performance statistics, and changing the menu to Initialize/Start give ready / running state information specifically about your loaded component since it can be paused, timed and re-initialized.\n\nControlling Engine State\n\nThe Engine process will be started by the TouchDesigner process and it will run your .tox component automatically. But you can have more control over the time/memory management of multiple components using the Unload, Reload pulse parameters for the currently-loaded .tox file. On the Advanced page, the Launch and Quit Engine Process parameters give you terminate/restart control of the entire Engine process.\n\nComponent Lifetime\n\nUnder TouchEngine, components are loaded into an already-running instance. For this reason, an Execute DAT's onStart() and onExit() method will never be executed under TouchEngine. The onCreate() method will be executed when the component is loaded, and is a good place to do any setup you would normally do in onStart().\n\nTime in TouchEngine\n\nWhen the Engine COMP starts the component (after it has loaded, if 'Start when Initialized' is On), the component time in TouchEngine is 0. It will then increase either in sync with the Engine COMP or according to TouchEngine's internal clock, depending on the setting of the 'Clock' parameter on the Tune parameter page.\n\nAn input buffer and output buffer are used to allow for differences in cook rate between the Engine COMP and TouchEngine. Often you may want to adjust the parameters on the Tune page to suit your particular setup. The Engine COMP will cook frames to fill its input buffer, if required, prior to starting to cook the component in TouchEngine - then will cook frames in TouchEngine to fill its output buffer prior to emitting output from the Engine COMP. The Auto setting will attempt to keep small buffers sufficient to avoid dropped frames, but you may wish to set a fixed buffer size to suit your setup, particularly if working with audio.\n\nTouchEngine Versions\n\nTouchEngine is installed as part of TouchDesigner, and the currently running version will be used to load the given .tox. If you wish to use a different version of TouchEngine you can either set the environment variable TOUCHENGINE_APP_PATH to the path to a TouchDesigner installation (an installation directory on Windows, or a TouchDesigner app on macOS) or install TouchDesigner into a folder named TouchEngine alongside the .tox (on macOS rename an application from TouchDesigner to TouchEngine) or create a link named TouchEngine alongside the .tox which points to an installation directory or TouchDesigner app.\n\nengineCOMP_Class\n\nThe Extensions parameter page sets the component's python extensions.  Please see extensions for more information.\n\nThe Common parameter page sets the component's node viewer and clone relationships.\n\nExtra Information for the Engine COMP can be accessed via an Info CHOP.\n\nTouchDesigner Build: Latest\\nwikieditorwikieditor",

      "category": "COMP",
      "description": "The FBX COMP imports geometry, animations and scenes using the FBX file format from Maya, 3DS Max, Cinema4D, Houdini and others.\nThe FBX COMP currently uses the 2020.3.7 (VS2022) version of the FBX SDK.\n\nFBX is a file format and set of libraries from Autodesk that is used to exchange models, animations and image/texture data between applications. The FBX COMP reads FBX files and supports most of its features. You can drag-drop a .fbx into a TouchDesigner network or import it via the File > Import File... menu. The FBX COMP can also import meshes from .obj and .4ds files, see also File Types.\n\nThe assets from the FBX file are saved into a \".tdc\" file with the same name as the FBX file inside the TDImportCache folder, which is created next to your .toe file. Assets are read from the \".tdc\" file using Import Select OPs (Import Select TOP / Import Select SOP / Import Select CHOP). Upon reloading a .toe file, the assets can be imported directly from the \".tdc\" cache, and the FBX file will not need to be re-imported. However, if there is no existing \".tdc\" (for instance, if the toe file changed computers) then the FBX file will be reopened to grab the assets and a new \".tdc\" will be saved out.\n\nTo open an FBX file in an FBX COMP:\n\n1) Specify a valid file path in the \"FBX File\" parameter, including the name of the file with correct .fbx extension.\n\n2) This step is varied depending on whether the FBX COMP is just created and if any changes in the default values of parameters are required or not. If the file is being loaded for the first time in the network and the default parameter values are accepted then simply press the \"Import\" button to generate the FBX network and import the assets. Note that we recommend changing the \"Import Method\" to to other modes (less work) can significantly improve performance. Generally, any changes in the parameters above the \"Import\" button requires the network to be built again.\n\n3) With the \"Import Method\" menu set to \"Merge with Existing\", the \"Import\" pulse will reload the internal assets (e.g. meshes, etc.) and this is specifically useful if the file has moved to another location and when the .toe file is opened the assets were not found and reloaded properly.\n\n4) With the \"Import Method\" menu set to \"Import Assets (Import Selects)\", the \"Import\" button is used when some changes on FBX file are made and we want to merge those changes into the current network without fully rebuilding it.\n\nAnimation channels: When there is animation in the FBX file, use the controls on the Play page to initialize, start and guide the animation. Also create an Info CHOP and attach it to the FBX COMP to watch its animation timing. The Info CHOP channels are similar to those of the Timer CHOP.\n\nTextures: Textures can either be embedded within the FBX file or external and referenced by a path to a texture file. For example, Blender has an option during FBX export to embed, otherwise they'll be external. If they're external then they may be exported with an absolute path to the texture file, which means if you move the FBX file to a different machine or relocate the file, then the textures will fail to load. In this case, if you are unable to re-export to embed the textures, then you can instead specify a search directory using the Texture Directory parameter so that the FBX COMP knows where to locate the texture files at import.\n\nfbxCOMP_Class\n\nNOTE: changes to any of the below parameters aren’t applied until the FBX File is rebuilt, either through \"Build Network\" or \"Update\".\n\nThis page includes the animation controls parameters of FBX within TouchDesigner.\n\nThe Xform parameter page controls the object component's transform in world space.\n\nThe Pre-Xform parameter page applies a transform to the object component the same way connecting another Object as a parent of this node does. The transform is applied to the left of the Xform page's parameters. In terms of matrix math, if we use the 'multiply on the right' (column vector) convention, the equation would be preXForm * xform * Position.\n\nThe Display parameter page controls the component's material and rendering settings.\n\nThe Extensions parameter page sets the component's python extensions.  Please see extensions for more information.\n\nThe Common parameter page sets the component's node viewer and clone relationships.\n\nExtra Information for the FBX COMP can be accessed via an Info CHOP.\n\nTouchDesigner Build: Latest\\nwikieditorwikieditorwikieditor2022.241402021.100002019.146502018.28070Error while fetching data from URL https://18.220.188.38/api.php?action=query&list=categorymembers&cmtitle=Category:COMPs&format=xml&cmlimit=500: $2.Error fetching URL: SSL: certificate subject name '*.derivative.ca' does not match target host name '18.220.188.38'There was a problem during the HTTP request: 0 ErrorCould not get URL https://18.220.188.38/api.php?action=query&list=categorymembers&cmtitle=Category:COMPs&format=xml&cmlimit=500 after 3 tries.",

      "description": "The FBX COMP imports geometry, animations and scenes using the FBX file format from Maya, 3DS Max, Cinema4D, Houdini and others.\nThe FBX COMP currently uses the 2020.3.7 (VS2022) version of the FBX SDK.\n\nFBX is a file format and set of libraries from Autodesk that is used to exchange models, animations and image/texture data between applications. The FBX COMP reads FBX files and supports most of its features. You can drag-drop a .fbx into a TouchDesigner network or import it via the File > Import File... menu. The FBX COMP can also import meshes from .obj and .4ds files, see also File Types.\n\nThe assets from the FBX file are saved into a \".tdc\" file with the same name as the FBX file inside the TDImportCache folder, which is created next to your .toe file. Assets are read from the \".tdc\" file using Import Select OPs (Import Select TOP / Import Select SOP / Import Select CHOP). Upon reloading a .toe file, the assets can be imported directly from the \".tdc\" cache, and the FBX file will not need to be re-imported. However, if there is no existing \".tdc\" (for instance, if the toe file changed computers) then the FBX file will be reopened to grab the assets and a new \".tdc\" will be saved out.\n\nTo open an FBX file in an FBX COMP:\n\n1) Specify a valid file path in the \"FBX File\" parameter, including the name of the file with correct .fbx extension.\n\n2) This step is varied depending on whether the FBX COMP is just created and if any changes in the default values of parameters are required or not. If the file is being loaded for the first time in the network and the default parameter values are accepted then simply press the \"Import\" button to generate the FBX network and import the assets. Note that we recommend changing the \"Import Method\" to to other modes (less work) can significantly improve performance. Generally, any changes in the parameters above the \"Import\" button requires the network to be built again.\n\n3) With the \"Import Method\" menu set to \"Merge with Existing\", the \"Import\" pulse will reload the internal assets (e.g. meshes, etc.) and this is specifically useful if the file has moved to another location and when the .toe file is opened the assets were not found and reloaded properly.\n\n4) With the \"Import Method\" menu set to \"Import Assets (Import Selects)\", the \"Import\" button is used when some changes on FBX file are made and we want to merge those changes into the current network without fully rebuilding it.\n\nAnimation channels: When there is animation in the FBX file, use the controls on the Play page to initialize, start and guide the animation. Also create an Info CHOP and attach it to the FBX COMP to watch its animation timing. The Info CHOP channels are similar to those of the Timer CHOP.\n\nTextures: Textures can either be embedded within the FBX file or external and referenced by a path to a texture file. For example, Blender has an option during FBX export to embed, otherwise they'll be external. If they're external then they may be exported with an absolute path to the texture file, which means if you move the FBX file to a different machine or relocate the file, then the textures will fail to load. In this case, if you are unable to re-export to embed the textures, then you can instead specify a search directory using the Texture Directory parameter so that the FBX COMP knows where to locate the texture files at import.\n\nfbxCOMP_Class\n\nNOTE: changes to any of the below parameters aren’t applied until the FBX File is rebuilt, either through \"Build Network\" or \"Update\".\n\nThe Xform parameter page controls the object component's transform in world space.\n\nThe Pre-Xform parameter page applies a transform to the object component the same way connecting another Object as a parent of this node does. The transform is applied to the left of the Xform page's parameters. In terms of matrix math, if we use the 'multiply on the right' (column vector) convention, the equation would be preXForm * xform * Position.\n\nThe Display parameter page controls the component's material and rendering settings.\n\nThe Extensions parameter page sets the component's python extensions.  Please see extensions for more information.\n\nThe Common parameter page sets the component's node viewer and clone relationships.\n\nExtra Information for the FBX COMP can be accessed via an Info CHOP.\n\nTouchDesigner Build: Latest\\nwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditor",

      "description": "Force COMPs are used to added forces to a physics solver's simulation. Bullet supports linear/rotational forces and impulse forces (see Force page) and Flex supports force fields (see Force Field page).\n\nActive forces are enabled using the Active toggle parameter on the Force page.\n\nAn active force will create a force in the simulation that is applied over time. An active force can either be applied globally by being referenced on the Bullet Solver COMP, or it can be applied locally by being referenced on an individual Actor COMP. The active force applies its force each frame, and the force applied over 1 second is equivalent to an impulse force of the same value applied in a single frame.\n\nThe units for the force and torque parameters are in Newtons (N), equivalent to kg*m/s^2. This means that if a force of 10N is applied to an actor with mass equal to 5kg and no initial velocity, then after 1 second the velocity of that actor will be 2m/s => 10N / 5kg * 1 sec = 2m/s. If all the parameters were the same, but instead it was an impulse force, then the velocity would still be 2m/s. However, the impulse force's velocity would change instantaneously and stop increasing (unless pulsed again) whereas with the active force the velocity will continue to increase after 1 second.\n\nThe center of mass is assumed to be center of the bounding box of the mass. By default, if a body is not constrained and not colliding, the force will not cause the body to rotate, unless the Relative Position parameter is set to a non-zero value.  If Relative Position is set to +1 in X and the force is +1 in Y, it will cause the body to rotate counter-clockwise around the Z-axis and translate in Y.\n\nIf the Torque is set to +1 in Z, it will cause the body to only rotate counter-clockwise in the Z-axis (a positive Z rotation), and not translate.\n\nTo apply force/torque to specific bodies use a Feedback CHOP (see Bullet Solver COMP or Actor COMP) and force[xyz] and torque[xyz] channels.\n\nImpulse forces are applied through the Impulse Force pulse parameter.\n\nAn impulse force pulse will create a force in the simulation that is applied for 1 frame. In the real world, impulse forces are forces applied over a very short duration, however in Bullet this is somewhat simplified, and they are instead applied instantly (for a single frame). Examples of impulse forces are kicking a ball or shooting a cannon. The velocities of the affected bodies are changed in an instant by the impulse force, and after that instant the force no longer has an effect unless applied again.\n\nThe resulting velocity of the bodies after the impulse force is applied is the same as an active force with the same values if the active force is applied for exactly 1 second. For example, if 10N of impulse force is applied to a body with mass 5kg then the resulting velocity will be 10N / 5kg * 1sec = 2m/s.\n\nForce fields are enabled through the Active parameter on the Force Field page.\n\nForce fields are spherical with a radius defined through the Radius parameter. Positive strength pushes bodies outward and negative strength pulls bodies inward.\n\nforceCOMP_Class\n\nThe Extensions parameter page sets the component's python extensions.  Please see extensions for more information.\n\nThe Common parameter page sets the component's node viewer and clone relationships.\n\nExtra Information for the Force COMP can be accessed via an Info CHOP.\n\nTouchDesigner Build: Latest\\nwikieditor2021.100002020.200002019.146502018.28070",

      "category": "COMP",
      "description": "The Geo Text COMP renders text in 3D. It does not read or generate a SOP as it does direct rendering using the Slug Library and can be lit and textured with any MAT material.\n\nYou can set fonts, colors, sizes, bold, italic, tracking, multi-lines like you can with the Text COMP. But because the Geo Text COMP doesn't have a boundary, width or height like the Text COMP, we substitute it with a layout box and the Layout Box parameters. The layout box has a width and height, and by default the bottom left of the layout box is placed at 0,0,0 in 3D space of the Geo Text COMP (\"object space\").  The Layout Box Anchor U and V let you put the center of the layout box at 0,0,0 by setting the anchors to .5, 5.\n\nThe layout box's size although you can't see it by default, is the Layout Box Size parameter.  With that you can right-justify or top-justify text in the layout box, and clip to the layout box.  You can also pad space aroud each side of the layout box.\n\nRender multiple strings transformed separately: The Specification DAT and Specification CHOP allow for individual strings to be each positioned and styled independently in 3D.\n\nEvery row of the Spec DAT represents a \"block\" or \"text block\". Every Spec DAT contains a column named text which is the string that overrides the Text parameter.\n\nMost columns override a Geo Text COMP parameter, such as text, tx and fontsize. Some column names noted below have no corresponding parameter.\n\nThe Spec CHOP can also specify values per block. When including a Spec CHOP the number of Spec CHOP samples needs to be the same number of rows as the Spec DAT following the first column header.\n\nParameters that can be overrided include fontsize, fontcolor, tracking etc., plus all the layout box and alignment parameters. Font/bold/italic are supported as columns as they are separate fonts.\n\nTransforming text blocks: The column or channel names can include tx, ty, tz and all the rotate and scale channels (which use the Transform Order parameter).\n\nA special column/channel called append can be used, when append is 1, to position one block of text relative to the end of the previous block. Regular transforms are inherited by each appended text block.\n\nLocal transforms (ltx, lrz, etc), can be used to apply additional transforms to a block that are not inherited by appended blocks. If the special column/channel localxform is set to 'pre', then the local transform is applied in world space before the inherited transforms are applied.\n\nNote - The Geo Text COMP uses blending/transparency to create the glyphs floating in space (Each glyph is a partially transparent rectangle), so to view  properly without the enclosing polygons that surround them, you need to ensure they are drawn after other geometry that they are sitting in-front of. This is usually due using the Draw Priority parameter on the 'Render' parameter page and making the value more negative than the Draw Priority of other objects. All things with the highest draw priority are drawn first, then all things with the same second higher draw priority are drawn second. If the priority is the same between two objects, then the order they are drawn is arbitrary and will possibly change. Note: Text within a Spec DAT should be setup so things in the back are earlier in the table than things in the front. It will draw row-by-row from the Spec DAT.\n\nSee OP Snippets for further transform options - relative and append.\n\nThe Geo Text COMP is similar to the Text COMP which is a 2D Panel.\n\ngeotextCOMP_Class\n\nThe Xform parameter page controls the object component's transform in world space.\n\nThe Pre-Xform parameter page applies a transform to the object component the same way connecting another Object as a parent of this node does. The transform is applied to the left of the Xform page's parameters. In terms of matrix math, if we use the 'multiply on the right' (column vector) convention, the equation would be preXForm * xform * Position.\n\nThe Instance parameter page provides the ability to create hardware instances of geometry. Each instance has an instance ID which can be passed into a MAT shader via a uniform value. The instance ID can be retrieved by the Render Pick CHOP. Any code in a vertex shader can customize the instance based on the instance ID.\n\nInstance's attributes can be individually driven by the data from any type of OP. When the instance data is supplied by a TOP, the TOP's RGBA channels are assigned to instance attributes, when data is supplied by a CHOP, the CHOP's channels are assigned to instance attributes, when from a SOP then the SOP's attributes are assigned to instance attributes, and when a DAT is used then a column is assigned to the instances attributes. The mapping of operator data to instance attributes is setup on the parameters below and on the Instance 2 and Instance 3 parameter pages.\n\nWhen the instance data is supplied by a TOP, the TOP's RGBA channels are assigned to instance attributes; when data is supplied by a CHOP, the CHOP's channels are assigned to instance attributes; when from a SOP then the SOP's attributes are assigned to instance attributes; and when a DAT is used then a column is assigned to the instances attributes.\n\nThis feature allows for arbitrary textures to be applied to instances. The textures do not need to be the same resolution, and they don't need to be combined into an grouped format such as a 3D Texture or a 2D Texture array. Multiple TOPs can be specified using the \"Instance Textures\" parameter, and the texture that is applied per-instance is specified using the channel chosen in the \"Texture Index\" parameter. This is different from a 3D Texture or 2D Texture Array, which would use the W texture coordinate to select a texture from within a single texture. By default this texture will be used as the \"Base Color Map\" texture for a PBR MAT, and the Color Map for all other materials such as the Phong MAT. For materials that support more than one map, the map that this this feature replaces can be chosen in the material's parameters. Currently on Windows at most 16384 textures can be used at once, and on macOS at most 128 textures can be used at once. These numbers are reduced by other textures that are used by the render such as other maps, cone light lookup map etc.\n\nCustom attributes allow arbitrary attributes to be assigned to instances, usable in a GLSL MAT. They can be accessed using TDInstanceCustomAttrib0(), TDInstanceCustomAttrib1() etc. For more information refer to Write a GLSL Material. These attributes will be ignored in other materials such as the PBR MAT.\n\nBelow you can add more parameters as you require more custom attributes. Different GPUs will have a different number of maximum custom attributes supported.\n\nThe Display parameter page controls the component's material and rendering settings.\n\nThe Extensions parameter page sets the component's python extensions.  Please see extensions for more information.\n\nThe Common parameter page sets the component's node viewer and clone relationships.\n\nTouchDesigner Build: Latest\\nwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditor2023.112802022.24140before 2022.24140",

        "Note - The Geo Text COMP uses blending/transparency to create the glyphs floating in space (Each glyph is a partially transparent rectangle), so to view  properly without the enclosing polygons that surround them, you need to ensure they are drawn after other geometry that they are sitting in-front of. This is usually due using the Draw Priority parameter on the 'Render' parameter page and making the value more negative than the Draw Priority of other objects. All things with the highest draw priority are drawn first, then all things with the same second higher draw priority are drawn second. If the priority is the same between two objects, then the order they are drawn is arbitrary and will possibly change. Note: Text within a Spec DAT should be setup so things in the back are earlier in the table than things in the front. It will draw row-by-row from the Spec DAT.",
        "Note: Scaling a camera's channels is not generally recommended. However, should you decide to do so, the rendered output will match the Viewport as closely as possible when scales are involved.",
        "Tip: To designate a center of interest for the camera that doesn't appear in your scene, create a Null Component and disable its display flag. Then Parent the Camera to the newly created Null Component, and tell the camera to look at this Component using the Look At parameter. You can direct the attention of the camera by moving the Null Component with the Select state. If you want to see both the camera and the Null Component, enable the Null Component's display flag, and use the Select state in an additional Viewport by clicking one of the icons in the top-right corner of the TouchDesigner window."

      "category": "COMP",
      "description": "The Geo Text COMP renders text in 3D. It does not read or generate a SOP as it does direct rendering using the Slug Library and can be lit and textured with any MAT material.\n\nYou can set fonts, colors, sizes, bold, italic, tracking, multi-lines like you can with the Text COMP. But because the Geo Text COMP doesn't have a boundary, width or height like the Text COMP, we substitute it with a layout box and the Layout Box parameters. The layout box has a width and height, and by default the bottom left of the layout box is placed at 0,0,0 in 3D space of the Geo Text COMP (\"object space\").  The Layout Box Anchor U and V let you put the center of the layout box at 0,0,0 by setting the anchors to .5, 5.\n\nThe layout box's size although you can't see it by default, is the Layout Box Size parameter.  With that you can right-justify or top-justify text in the layout box, and clip to the layout box.  You can also pad space aroud each side of the layout box.\n\nRender multiple strings transformed separately: The Specification DAT and Specification CHOP allow for individual strings to be each positioned and styled independently in 3D.\n\nEvery row of the Spec DAT represents a \"block\" or \"text block\". Every Spec DAT contains a column named text which is the string that overrides the Text parameter.\n\nMost columns override a Geo Text COMP parameter, such as text, tx and fontsize. Some column names noted below have no corresponding parameter.\n\nThe Spec CHOP can also specify values per block. When including a Spec CHOP the number of Spec CHOP samples needs to be the same number of rows as the Spec DAT following the first column header.\n\nParameters that can be overrided include fontsize, fontcolor, tracking etc., plus all the layout box and alignment parameters. Font/bold/italic are supported as columns as they are separate fonts.\n\nTransforming text blocks: The column or channel names can include tx, ty, tz and all the rotate and scale channels (which use the Transform Order parameter).\n\nA special column/channel called append can be used, when append is 1, to position one block of text relative to the end of the previous block. Regular transforms are inherited by each appended text block.\n\nLocal transforms (ltx, lrz, etc), can be used to apply additional transforms to a block that are not inherited by appended blocks. If the special column/channel localxform is set to 'pre', then the local transform is applied in world space before the inherited transforms are applied.\n\nNote - The Geo Text COMP uses blending/transparency to create the glyphs floating in space (Each glyph is a partially transparent rectangle), so to view  properly without the enclosing polygons that surround them, you need to ensure they are drawn after other geometry that they are sitting in-front of. This is usually due using the Draw Priority parameter on the 'Render' parameter page and making the value more negative than the Draw Priority of other objects. All things with the highest draw priority are drawn first, then all things with the same second higher draw priority are drawn second. If the priority is the same between two objects, then the order they are drawn is arbitrary and will possibly change. Note: Text within a Spec DAT should be setup so things in the back are earlier in the table than things in the front. It will draw row-by-row from the Spec DAT.\n\nSee OP Snippets for further transform options - relative and append.\n\nThe Geo Text COMP is similar to the Text COMP which is a 2D Panel.\n\ngeotextCOMP_Class\n\nThe Xform parameter page controls the object component's transform in world space.\n\nThe Pre-Xform parameter page applies a transform to the object component the same way connecting another Object as a parent of this node does. The transform is applied to the left of the Xform page's parameters. In terms of matrix math, if we use the 'multiply on the right' (column vector) convention, the equation would be preXForm * xform * Position.\n\nThe Instance parameter page provides the ability to create hardware instances of geometry. Each instance has an instance ID which can be passed into a MAT shader via a uniform value. The instance ID can be retrieved by the Render Pick CHOP. Any code in a vertex shader can customize the instance based on the instance ID.\n\nInstance's attributes can be individually driven by the data from any type of OP. When the instance data is supplied by a TOP, the TOP's RGBA channels are assigned to instance attributes, when data is supplied by a CHOP, the CHOP's channels are assigned to instance attributes, when from a SOP then the SOP's attributes are assigned to instance attributes, and when a DAT is used then a column is assigned to the instances attributes. The mapping of operator data to instance attributes is setup on the parameters below and on the Instance 2 and Instance 3 parameter pages.\n\nWhen the instance data is supplied by a TOP, the TOP's RGBA channels are assigned to instance attributes; when data is supplied by a CHOP, the CHOP's channels are assigned to instance attributes; when from a SOP then the SOP's attributes are assigned to instance attributes; and when a DAT is used then a column is assigned to the instances attributes.\n\nThis feature allows for arbitrary textures to be applied to instances. The textures do not need to be the same resolution, and they don't need to be combined into an grouped format such as a 3D Texture or a 2D Texture array. Multiple TOPs can be specified using the \"Instance Textures\" parameter, and the texture that is applied per-instance is specified using the channel chosen in the \"Texture Index\" parameter. This is different from a 3D Texture or 2D Texture Array, which would use the W texture coordinate to select a texture from within a single texture. By default this texture will be used as the \"Base Color Map\" texture for a PBR MAT, and the Color Map for all other materials such as the Phong MAT. For materials that support more than one map, the map that this this feature replaces can be chosen in the material's parameters. Currently on Windows at most 16384 textures can be used at once, and on macOS at most 128 textures can be used at once. These numbers are reduced by other textures that are used by the render such as other maps, cone light lookup map etc.\n\nCustom attributes allow arbitrary attributes to be assigned to instances, usable in a GLSL MAT. They can be accessed using TDInstanceCustomAttrib0(), TDInstanceCustomAttrib1() etc. For more information refer to Write a GLSL Material. These attributes will be ignored in other materials such as the PBR MAT.\n\nBelow you can add more parameters as you require more custom attributes. Different GPUs will have a different number of maximum custom attributes supported.\n\nThe Display parameter page controls the component's material and rendering settings.\n\nThe Extensions parameter page sets the component's python extensions.  Please see extensions for more information.\n\nThe Common parameter page sets the component's node viewer and clone relationships.\n\nTouchDesigner Build: Latest\\nwikieditorwikieditor",

        "Note - The Geo Text COMP uses blending/transparency to create the glyphs floating in space (Each glyph is a partially transparent rectangle), so to view  properly without the enclosing polygons that surround them, you need to ensure they are drawn after other geometry that they are sitting in-front of. This is usually due using the Draw Priority parameter on the 'Render' parameter page and making the value more negative than the Draw Priority of other objects. All things with the highest draw priority are drawn first, then all things with the same second higher draw priority are drawn second. If the priority is the same between two objects, then the order they are drawn is arbitrary and will possibly change. Note: Text within a Spec DAT should be setup so things in the back are earlier in the table than things in the front. It will draw row-by-row from the Spec DAT.",
        "Note: Scaling a camera's channels is not generally recommended. However, should you decide to do so, the rendered output will match the Viewport as closely as possible when scales are involved.",
        "Tip: To designate a center of interest for the camera that doesn't appear in your scene, create a Null Component and disable its display flag. Then Parent the Camera to the newly created Null Component, and tell the camera to look at this Component using the Look At parameter. You can direct the attention of the camera by moving the Null Component with the Select state. If you want to see both the camera and the Null Component, enable the Null Component's display flag, and use the Select state in an additional Viewport by clicking one of the icons in the top-right corner of the TouchDesigner window."

      "description": "The Geometry Component is a 3D surface or 3D Object that you render in TouchDesigner with a Render TOP. Lights, Cameras and other Components affect the scene, but are not visible surfaces.\n\nEach Geometry Component contains a Network containing SOPs (and any other node types), where SOPs are the operators that define its 3D shape. The 3D surfaces can be polygons, particles, sprites, meshes, NURBS (with trim curves), Bezier patches or metaballs. They can be shaded as solid-shaded surfaces or as wireframes.\n\nIn the Geometry COMP's network\n\nNOTE: Most often users turn on/off the Render and Display flags together so they are always in the same state.\n\nSee Geometry Viewer to learn about how you can inspect the SOPs that are turned on for display.\n\nSome SOPs, like the Texture SOP determine how texture images wrap and fit on the surface.\n\nEvery Geometry component needs a Material (MAT) operator to apply to the surface. This is assigned in the Material parameter of the Geometry component, or with a Material SOP.\n\nTo get to the Geometry Component's network, use the roller wheel to zoom into it, or hit Enter or 'i' after selecting a Geometry Component.\n\nSee Geometry Viewer, Render Flag and Display Flag.\n\ngeometryCOMP_Class\n\nThe Xform parameter page controls the object component's transform in world space.\n\nThe Pre-Xform parameter page applies a transform to the object component the same way connecting another Object as a parent of this node does. The transform is applied to the left of the Xform page's parameters. In terms of matrix math, if we use the 'multiply on the right' (column vector) convention, the equation would be preXForm * xform * Position.\n\nThe Instance parameter page provides the ability to create hardware instances of geometry. Each instance has an instance ID which can be passed into a MAT shader via a uniform value. The instance ID can be retrieved by the Render Pick CHOP. Any code in a vertex shader can customize the instance based on the instance ID.\n\nInstance's attributes can be individually driven by the data from any type of OP. When the instance data is supplied by a TOP, the TOP's RGBA channels are assigned to instance attributes, when data is supplied by a CHOP, the CHOP's channels are assigned to instance attributes, when from a SOP then the SOP's attributes are assigned to instance attributes, and when a DAT is used then a column is assigned to the instances attributes. The mapping of operator data to instance attributes is setup on the parameters below and on the Instance 2 and Instance 3 parameter pages.\n\nWhen the instance data is supplied by a TOP, the TOP's RGBA channels are assigned to instance attributes; when data is supplied by a CHOP, the CHOP's channels are assigned to instance attributes; when from a SOP then the SOP's attributes are assigned to instance attributes; and when a DAT is used then a column is assigned to the instances attributes.\n\nThis feature allows for arbitrary textures to be applied to instances. The textures do not need to be the same resolution, and they don't need to be combined into an grouped format such as a 3D Texture or a 2D Texture array. Multiple TOPs can be specified using the \"Instance Textures\" parameter, and the texture that is applied per-instance is specified using the channel chosen in the \"Texture Index\" parameter. This is different from a 3D Texture or 2D Texture Array, which would use the W texture coordinate to select a texture from within a single texture. By default this texture will be used as the \"Base Color Map\" texture for a PBR MAT, and the Color Map for all other materials such as the Phong MAT. For materials that support more than one map, the map that this this feature replaces can be chosen in the material's parameters. Currently on Windows at most 16384 textures can be used at once, and on macOS at most 128 textures can be used at once. These numbers are reduced by other textures that are used by the render such as other maps, cone light lookup map etc.\n\nCustom attributes allow arbitrary attributes to be assigned to instances, usable in a GLSL MAT. They can be accessed using TDInstanceCustomAttrib0(), TDInstanceCustomAttrib1() etc. For more information refer to Write a GLSL Material. These attributes will be ignored in other materials such as the PBR MAT.\n\nBelow you can add more parameters as you require more custom attributes. Different GPUs will have a different number of maximum custom attributes supported.\n\nThe Display parameter page controls the component's material and rendering settings.\n\nThe Extensions parameter page sets the component's python extensions.  Please see extensions for more information.\n\nThe Common parameter page sets the component's node viewer and clone relationships.\n\nExtra Information for the Geometry COMP can be accessed via an Info CHOP.\n\nTouchDesigner Build: Latest\\nwikieditorwikieditormw-replace2021.100002020.200002018.28070before 2018.28070",

You can direct the attention of the camera by moving the Null Component with the Select state. If you want to see both the camera and the Null Component, enable the Null Component's display flag, and use the Select state in an additional Viewport by clicking one of the icons in the top-right corner of the TouchDesigner window."

      "description": "The Handle Component is a new IK tool designed for manipulating groups of bones. Whereas the previous IK tools only allowed for a single end-affector per bone chain, this new method allows for several end-affectors per bone. Furthermore, the bones need not be a chain. Any setup, including branches, are handled.\n\nOne typical example is the use of motion capture data. In higher-end systems, you could have a cloud of marker positions and a skeleton to be driven by it.\n\nThis Handle Component works in tandem with the Handle CHOP. The following setup is commonly used: Given a hierarchy of bones, attach one or more Handle Components to specific locations on each Bone Component. Assign each handle a target in space to follow. Create a Handle CHOP which collects this information and calculates the rotation channels for the bones. Export these values back to the bones.\n\nhandleCOMP_Class\n\nThe Display parameter page controls the component's material and rendering settings.\n\nThe Extensions parameter page sets the component's python extensions.  Please see extensions for more information.\n\nThe Common parameter page sets the component's node viewer and clone relationships.\n\nExtra Information for the Handle COMP can be accessed via an Info CHOP.\n\nTouchDesigner Build: Latest\\nwikieditor2021.100002018.28070before 2018.28070",

In the real world, impulse forces are forces applied over a very short duration, however in Bullet this is somewhat simplified, and they are instead applied instantly (for a single frame). Examples of impulse forces are kicking a ball or shooting a cannon. The velocities of the affected bodies are changed in an instant by the impulse force, and after that instant the force no longer has an effect unless applied again.\n\nThe resulting velocity of the bodies after the impulse force is applied is the same as the Force COMP with the same values if the Force COMP is applied for exactly 1 second. For example, if 10N of Impulse Force is applied to a body with mass 5kg then the resulting velocity will be 10N / 5kg * 1sec = 2m/s.\n\nimpulseforceCOMP_Class\n\nThe Extensions parameter page sets the component's python extensions.  Please see extensions for more information.\n\nThe Common parameter page sets the component's node viewer and clone relationships.\n\nTouchDesigner Build: Latest\\n2021.100002019.146502018.28070",

A scene can also be viewed through a light's perspective, similar to a Camera COMP.\n\nTip: To avoid a light from consuming compute time when it's off, make the Dimmer parameter less than .001.\n\nSee Geometry Viewer to learn about how you can inspect from a light.\n\nlightCOMP_Class\n\nThe Xform parameter page controls the object component's transform in world space.\n\nThe Pre-Xform parameter page applies a transform to the object component the same way connecting another Object as a parent of this node does. The transform is applied to the left of the Xform page's parameters. In terms of matrix math, if we use the 'multiply on the right' (column vector) convention, the equation would be preXForm * xform * Position.\n\nEnabling shadows will cause this node to render the scene in a depth-only pass to create a shadow map. This map will then be used by Render TOPs when rendering to create shadows for objects lit by this light. The shadow map that is created can be obtained using a Depth TOP, for cases where custom rendering is being done.\n\nThe Display parameter page controls the component's material and rendering settings.\n\nThe Extensions parameter page sets the component's python extensions.  Please see extensions for more information.\n\nThe Common parameter page sets the component's node viewer and clone relationships.\n\nExtra Information for the Light COMP can be accessed via an Info CHOP.\n\nTouchDesigner Build: Latest\\nwikieditor2022.241402021.100002018.28070before 2018.28070",

Then Parent the Camera to the newly created Null Component, and tell the camera to look at this Component using the Look At parameter. You can direct the attention of the camera by moving the Null Component with the Select state. If you want to see both the camera and the Null Component, enable the Null Component's display flag, and use the Select state in an additional Viewport by clicking one of the icons in the top-right corner of the TouchDesigner window."

The provided info dictionary in those callbacks will include a listCell member describing what cell is being dragged or dropped on. A ListCell can also be in the dragItems list.\n\nListCell objects contain the following members:\n\nTo create a ListCell object, use this function: ListCell(owner, row, col)\n\nThe Layout parameter page controls the size and position of the panel.\n\nThe Panel parameter page controls panel attributes such as display on/off, enable on/off, panel help, and interactions with the cursor.\n\nThe Color parameter page sets the panel's background, border, and disabled colors.\n\nThe Children parameter page controls aspects of the Panel's children alignment, size, and position.\n\nPlease refer to Drag-and-Drop for a full explanation on how Drag and Drop between Panel Components functions.\n\nThe Extensions parameter page sets the component's python extensions.

Refer to the Build a List COMP article for more info on using this COMP.\n\nSee Also: Lister Custom COMP, a Python enhanced custom listCOMP.\n\nlistCOMP_Class\n\nEvery cell, row, column and table in a List component is described by attributes which are specified through the initialize and callback functions of the List component. \t\t\t\nFor usage please refer to the  listCOMP_Class page.\n\nThe listCOMP uses Drag/Drop Callbacks to implement dragging and dropping behavior. The provided info dictionary in those callbacks will include a listCell member describing what cell is being dragged or dropped on. A ListCell can also be in the dragItems list.\n\nListCell objects contain the following members:\n\nTo create a ListCell object, use this function: ListCell(owner, row, col)\n\nThe Layout parameter page controls the size and position of the panel.\n\nThe Panel parameter page controls panel attributes such as display on/off, enable on/off, panel help, and interactions with the cursor.\n\nThe Color parameter page sets the panel's background, border, and disabled colors.\n\nThe Children parameter page controls aspects of the Panel's children alignment, size, and position.\n\nPlease refer to Drag-and-Drop for a full explanation on how Drag and Drop between Panel Components functions.\n\nThe Extensions parameter page sets the component's python extensions.  Please see extensions for more information.\n\nThe Common parameter page sets the component's node viewer and clone relationships.\n\nExtra Information for the List COMP can be accessed via an Info CHOP.",

It can be used to transform (translate, rotate, scale) Components attached to it.\n\nA Null Component can also be used as a \"look at\" object to help point other Components like cameras or lights.\n\nThe Null Component is also used as an End Affector for constructing chains of bones.\n\nnullCOMP_Class\n\nThe Xform parameter page controls the object component's transform in world space.\n\nThe Pre-Xform parameter page applies a transform to the object component the same way connecting another Object as a parent of this node does. The transform is applied to the left of the Xform page's parameters. In terms of matrix math, if we use the 'multiply on the right' (column vector) convention, the equation would be preXForm * xform * Position.\n\nThe Display parameter page controls the component's material and rendering settings.\n\nThe Extensions parameter page sets the component's python extensions.  Please see extensions for more information.\n\nThe Common parameter page sets the component's node viewer and clone relationships.\n\nExtra Information for the Null COMP can be accessed via an Info CHOP.\n\nTouchDesigner Build: Latest\\nwikieditormw-replace2022.241402021.100002018.28070before 2018.28070",

You can direct the attention of the camera by moving the Null Component with the Select state. If you want to see both the camera and the Null Component, enable the Null Component's display flag, and use the Select state in an additional Viewport by clicking one of the icons in the top-right corner of the TouchDesigner window."

      "description": "The Nvidia Flex Solver COMP is a physics solver COMP similar to the Bullet Solver COMP.\n\nIn an Nvidia Flex simulation, the Nvidia Flex Solver COMP is analogous to the world/simulation in which actors/bodies (ie. Actor COMPs) operate. An Nvidia Flex Solver COMP contains any number of actors/bodies (Actor COMPs) or force fields (Force COMP), and as the name suggests it uses Nvidia's FleX particle physics API.\n\nThe Nvidia Flex Solver COMP runs an Nvidia Flex simulation based on some simulation parameters (eg. particle radius and cohesion) and updates the transformations of the Actor COMPs contained within it as the simulation progresses forward.\n\nThe Actor COMPs referenced by the Nvidia Flex Solver COMP do not need to be inside its network. They can be anywhere as long as they are not already referenced by another Solver COMP (Nvidia Flex or Bullet).\n\nNote: Recent driver versions break certain features (such as multiple colliders), so it is recommended to use Nvidia driver version 546.xx. As a result, Nvidia Flex will also have issues on more recent Nvidia cards like those in the Nvidia RTX 50 series, which have a minimum driver of 570.xx.\n\nflexsolverCOMP_Class\n\nThe Xform parameter page controls the object component's transform in world space.\n\nThe Pre-Xform parameter page applies a transform to the object component the same way connecting another Object as a parent of this node does. The transform is applied to the left of the Xform page's parameters. In terms of matrix math, if we use the 'multiply on the right' (column vector) convention, the equation would be preXForm * xform * Position.\n\nThe Display parameter page controls the component's material and rendering settings.\n\nThe Extensions parameter page sets the component's python extensions.  Please see extensions for more information.\n\nThe Common parameter page sets the component's node viewer and clone relationships.\n\nExtra Information for the Nvidia Flex Solver COMP can be accessed via an Info CHOP.\n\nTouchDesigner Build: Latest\\nwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditor2021.10000before 2021.10000",

Then Parent the Camera to the newly created Null Component, and tell the camera to look at this Component using the Look At parameter. You can direct the attention of the camera by moving the Null Component with the Select state. If you want to see both the camera and the Null Component, enable the Null Component's display flag, and use the Select state in an additional Viewport by clicking one of the icons in the top-right corner of the TouchDesigner window."

      "category": "COMP",
      "description": "NVIDIA Flow is a volumetric fluid based simulation of a burning gas system. The user controls the 3 main factors of temperature, fuel, and smoke to create fire and smoke simulations.\n\nThe Nvidia Flow COMP is the fuel emitter for the Flow simulation and can be placed anywhere in the 3D scene.\n\nflowEmitterCOMP_Class\n\nFigure1: Left-side Inner Width = 1.0, Center uses narrow width for both, Right-side Outer Width = 1.0\n\nFlow simulation color has 3 independant parts: color, alpha, and intensity which are based on the burn, smoke, temperature and fuel levels. The masks below control how much each value influences the color.\n\nThe final color value is calculated using ((Burn * Burn Mask) + (Smoke * Smoke Mask) + (Temp * Temp Mask) + (Fuel * Fuel Mask)) \nIntensity brightens the respective Color and Alpha like a multiplier.\n\nThe Xform parameter page controls the object component's transform in world space.\n\nThe Pre-Xform parameter page applies a transform to the object component the same way connecting another Object as a parent of this node does. The transform is applied to the left of the Xform page's parameters. In terms of matrix math, if we use the 'multiply on the right' (column vector) convention, the equation would be preXForm * xform * Position.\n\nThe Instance parameter page provides the ability to create hardware instances of geometry. Each instance has an instance ID which can be passed into a MAT shader via a uniform value. The instance ID can be retrieved by the Render Pick CHOP. Any code in a vertex shader can customize the instance based on the instance ID.\n\nInstance's attributes can be individually driven by the data from any type of OP. When the instance data is supplied by a TOP, the TOP's RGBA channels are assigned to instance attributes, when data is supplied by a CHOP, the CHOP's channels are assigned to instance attributes, when from a SOP then the SOP's attributes are assigned to instance attributes, and when a DAT is used then a column is assigned to the instances attributes. The mapping of operator data to instance attributes is setup on the parameters below and on the Instance 2 and Instance 3 parameter pages.\n\nWhen the instance data is supplied by a TOP, the TOP's RGBA channels are assigned to instance attributes; when data is supplied by a CHOP, the CHOP's channels are assigned to instance attributes; when from a SOP then the SOP's attributes are assigned to instance attributes; and when a DAT is used then a column is assigned to the instances attributes.\n\nThis feature allows for arbitrary textures to be applied to instances. The textures do not need to be the same resolution, and they don't need to be combined into an grouped format such as a 3D Texture or a 2D Texture array. Multiple TOPs can be specified using the \"Instance Textures\" parameter, and the texture that is applied per-instance is specified using the channel chosen in the \"Texture Index\" parameter. This is different from a 3D Texture or 2D Texture Array, which would use the W texture coordinate to select a texture from within a single texture. By default this texture will be used as the \"Base Color Map\" texture for a PBR MAT, and the Color Map for all other materials such as the Phong MAT. For materials that support more than one map, the map that this this feature replaces can be chosen in the material's parameters. Currently on Windows at most 16384 textures can be used at once, and on macOS at most 128 textures can be used at once. These numbers are reduced by other textures that are used by the render such as other maps, cone light lookup map etc.\n\nThe Display parameter page controls the component's material and rendering settings.\n\nThe Extensions parameter page sets the component's python extensions.  Please see extensions for more information.\n\nThe Common parameter page sets the component's node viewer and clone relationships.\n\nExtra Information for the Nvidia Flow Emitter COMP can be accessed via an Info CHOP.\n\nTouchDesigner Build: Latest\\nwikieditorwikieditor2021.100002020.200002019.146502018.28070",

Then Parent the Camera to the newly created Null Component, and tell the camera to look at this Component using the Look At parameter. You can direct the attention of the camera by moving the Null Component with the Select state. If you want to see both the camera and the Null Component, enable the Null Component's display flag, and use the Select state in an additional Viewport by clicking one of the icons in the top-right corner of the TouchDesigner window."

You specify which operator whose parameters you want to appear in the panel.\n\nYou can optionally have it display the header and the page names, and include built-in or Custom Parameters.\n\nYou can specify a scope of pages and individual parameters to display, for example two entire pages plus four parameters on other pages.  When specifying parameters only, the order of the parameters is the order you specify them in.\n\nYou can shrink the UI so it fits into a smaller panel, using the Compress parameter.\n\nYou can control whether users can open the parameter for editing (via the + on the left of the parameter) using the Allow Expansion toggle. You can prevent users from going in and editing expressions.\n\nYou can specify page or parameter names using pattern matching: scale*  ^tx, etc, with page names that contain spaces specified in quotes. 'Cue 1' 'Cue 2', or specified as a python list.\n\nparameterCOMP_Class\n\nThe Layout parameter page controls the size and position of the panel.\n\nThe Panel parameter page controls panel attributes such as display on/off, enable on/off, panel help, and interactions with the cursor.\n\nThe Color parameter page sets the panel's background, border, and disabled colors.\n\nThe Children parameter page controls aspects of the Panel's children alignment, size, and position.\n\nPlease refer to Drag-and-Drop for a full explanation on how Drag and Drop between Panel Components functions.\n\nThe Extensions parameter page sets the component's python extensions.  Please see extensions for more information.\n\nThe Common parameter page sets the component's node viewer and clone relationships.\n\nExtra Information for the Parameter COMP can be accessed via an Info CHOP.\n\nTouchDesigner Build: Latest\\nwikieditor2022.241402021.100002018.28070before 2018.28070",

When specifying parameters only, the order of the parameters is the order you specify them in.\n\nYou can shrink the UI so it fits into a smaller panel, using the Compress parameter.\n\nYou can control whether users can open the parameter for editing (via the + on the left of the parameter) using the Allow Expansion toggle. You can prevent users from going in and editing expressions.\n\nYou can specify page or parameter names using pattern matching: scale*  ^tx, etc, with page names that contain spaces specified in quotes. 'Cue 1' 'Cue 2', or specified as a python list.\n\nparameterCOMP_Class\n\nThe Layout parameter page controls the size and position of the panel.\n\nThe Panel parameter page controls panel attributes such as display on/off, enable on/off, panel help, and interactions with the cursor.\n\nThe Color parameter page sets the panel's background, border, and disabled colors.\n\nThe Children parameter page controls aspects of the Panel's children alignment, size, and position.\n\nPlease refer to Drag-and-Drop for a full explanation on how Drag and Drop between Panel Components functions.\n\nThe Extensions parameter page sets the component's python extensions.  Please see extensions for more information.\n\nThe Common parameter page sets the component's node viewer and clone relationships.\n\nExtra Information for the Parameter COMP can be accessed via an Info CHOP.\n\nTouchDesigner Build: Latest\\nwikieditorwikieditorwikieditor",

      "description": "The Replicator COMP creates copies of a component, one for every row in a table or using a Number of Replicants parameter - it is the \"for-loop\" of operators. Unlike Clone, it automatically creates copies of a master component.\n\nIt creates replicant nodes (\"replicants\") and deletes them as the table changes or the replicant count changes. The replicant master can be a full component and its contents or a single node.\n\nIt takes the node specified in the Master Node parameter, and makes a copy of the master for every row in the Template Table (or specified by the Number of Replicant parameter).\n\nThe nodes that are created can be named in two ways. Copies can be named/numbered sequentially using\t\t\t\nthe prefix specified by the Node Prefix parameter: item1, item2, ... Alternately, copies can be named based on the string in a column of the table, specified with the Name from Table parameter.\n\nIf you want to create a node for the first row of the table, un-set the Ignore First Row parameter.\n\nThe replicants get laid out in a grid in the network, determined by the Layout and Layout Origin parameters.\n\nThe Replicator does not assume or require that the master and replicants are components – they can all be Movie File In TOPs if you want. It also does not assume or require that the replicants are Clones.  However the Master Node can be a component whose Clone parameter is set to itself, so that all nodes created are clones of the master.\n\nFor every replicant, you can run a script in the callback DAT where you can see some examples of typical cases that you can adapt. Here are some others:\n\nIf only one line of a table changes, the other existing replicants are not changed or re-created. In the callback DAT, removing onRemoveReplicant() will keep the replicants around to be re-used when the table grows again.\n\nThis is an extremely powerful node type. Examples: (1) A button gadget for each row of the table. a geometry component, which is replicated at every point of a 3D particle system, each behaving separately. (2) You can feed the table of a Multi Touch In DAT directly to the Replicator to create something at each fingertip.\n\nreplicatorCOMP_Class\n\nThe Extensions parameter page sets the component's python extensions.  Please see extensions for more information.\n\nThe Common parameter page sets the component's node viewer and clone relationships.\n\nExtra Information for the Replicator COMP can be accessed via an Info CHOP.\n\nTouchDesigner Build: Latest\\nwikieditor2021.100002018.28070before 2018.28070",

These panels are laid out in a grid format where the contents of each cell are defined by DAT tables.\n\ntableCOMP_Class\n\nEvery cell in a Table component is described by attributes in a DAT table describing its font, size, color, etc.  These attributes may be located in different tables.  For each cell in the table, attributes are first searched in a corresponding cell attribute table, followed by a row attribute table, followed by a column attribute table, finally followed by a table attribute table.\n\nThese attribute tables are themselves found using a second level of lookup tables, that use the current state of the cell for that lookup.  The possible cell states are:\n\nThe state of each cell can be examined with an Info DAT.\n\nThe attribute tables are organized as follows:\n\nThe current list of available attributes are:\n\nIf a path to a table of values is specified, then this table consists of one row for each cell.  If your table is not in this format, it can be modified easily.  For example if the value table DAT has 3x2 cells, append a DAT to CHOP followed by a CHOP to DAT .\nIn the CHOP, set the following parameters:\n\nThis will produce a table with 1 column and 6 rows as required, providing all the values are numeric.\n\nThe Layout parameter page controls the size and position of the panel.\n\nThe Panel parameter page controls panel attributes such as display on/off, enable on/off, panel help, and interactions with the cursor.\n\nThe Color parameter page sets the panel's background, border, and disabled colors.\n\nThe Children parameter page controls aspects of the Panel's children alignment, size, and position.\n\nPlease refer to Drag-and-Drop for a full explanation on how Drag and Drop between Panel Components functions.\n\nThe Extensions parameter page sets the component's python extensions.  Please see extensions for more information.\n\nThe Common parameter page sets the component's node viewer and clone relationships.\n\nExtra Information for the Table COMP can be accessed via an Info CHOP.\n\nTouchDesigner Build: Latest\\nwikieditor2021.100002018.28070before 2018.28070",

      "description": "The Text COMP is a panel used to display text for building user interfaces. The text can be view-only, view-only but copy/pasteable, or be fully editable directly in the panel.\n\nThere are formatting modes for displaying single-line strings and multi-line text, floating point and integer numbers, password fields and more. The source of the text comes from the Text parameter and it is then formatted for display in the panel. Formatting examples include displaying a number as a currency, percent or scientific notation, or converting an integer timecode value to hours/minutes/seconds/frames. Other formatting options include support for Python syntax, Custom C++ Fmt and Custom Python F-String syntax.\n\nWhen a user clicks in the panel to edit the text, the contents are displayed in a raw format and then formatted again once the editing is completed.\n\nThe Text COMP supports inline formatting directives in the text for things like color, strikeouts, underlines, small caps, subscripts, gradients, etc. For example, the code {#color(255, 0, 0);} will turn all text that follows on that line red.\n\nIt has text-fitting options for wraparound, shrinking text if it doesn't fit, left-center-right alignment and language reading direction. View-only text can be selectable or not selectable.\n\nYou can draw multiple transformed/formatted strings using a \"Specification DAT\" table: It draws one string per row of the table, each with its own position and formatting in your panel. Columns can be x, y, text, fontsize, fontcolorr, fontcolorg, fontcolorb, fontalpha, skew, tracking and horzstretch. You can also use a Specification CHOP for the numeric values of the text attributes.\n\nEvery row of the Spec DAT represents a \"block\" or \"text block\". Every Spec DAT contains a column named text which is the string that overrides the Text parameter.\n\nIt has python callbacks that can be executed for every character or string that has changed, and a callback for change of focus.\n\nResolution-independent text is drawn directly to the screen at the resolution required for the panel size, resulting in perfectly crisp text at all zoom levels.

Default Font Size, Text Offsets and Padding are in panel units.\n\nSee Operator Snippets for examples of the Text COMP.\n\nSee Text Formatting Codes\n\nNote: The Text COMP is a replacement for the Field COMP, completely replacing it and adding many new features not previously available.\n\ntextCOMP_Class\n\nThe Layout parameter page controls the size and position of the panel.\n\nThe Panel parameter page controls panel attributes such as display on/off, enable on/off, panel help, and interactions with the cursor.\n\nThe Color parameter page sets the panel's background, border, and disabled colors.\n\nThe Children parameter page controls aspects of the Panel's children alignment, size, and position.\n\nPlease refer to Drag-and-Drop for a full explanation on how Drag and Drop between Panel Components functions.\n\nThe Extensions parameter page sets the component's python extensions.  Please see extensions for more information.\n\nThe Common parameter page sets the component's node viewer and clone relationships.\n\nTouchDesigner Build: Latest\\nwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditor2023.112802022.24140before 2022.24140",

      "description": "The Text COMP is a panel used to display text for building user interfaces. The text can be view-only, view-only but copy/pasteable, or be fully editable directly in the panel.\n\nThere are formatting modes for displaying single-line strings and multi-line text, floating point and integer numbers, password fields and more. The source of the text comes from the Text parameter and it is then formatted for display in the panel. Formatting examples include displaying a number as a currency, percent or scientific notation, or converting an integer timecode value to hours/minutes/seconds/frames. Other formatting options include support for Python syntax, Custom C++ Fmt and Custom Python F-String syntax.\n\nWhen a user clicks in the panel to edit the text, the contents are displayed in a raw format and then formatted again once the editing is completed.\n\nThe Text COMP supports inline formatting directives in the text for things like color, strikeouts, underlines, small caps, subscripts, gradients, etc. For example, the code {#color(255, 0, 0);} will turn all text that follows on that line red.\n\nIt has text-fitting options for wraparound, shrinking text if it doesn't fit, left-center-right alignment and language reading direction. View-only text can be selectable or not selectable.\n\nYou can draw multiple transformed/formatted strings using a \"Specification DAT\" table: It draws one string per row of the table, each with its own position and formatting in your panel. Columns can be x, y, text, fontsize, fontcolorr, fontcolorg, fontcolorb, fontalpha, skew, tracking and horzstretch. You can also use a Specification CHOP for the numeric values of the text attributes.\n\nEvery row of the Spec DAT represents a \"block\" or \"text block\". Every Spec DAT contains a column named text which is the string that overrides the Text parameter.\n\nIt has python callbacks that can be executed for every character or string that has changed, and a callback for change of focus.\n\nResolution-independent text is drawn directly to the screen at the resolution required for the panel size, resulting in perfectly crisp text at all zoom levels. It is GPU-based using the Slug Library.\n\nUnits for X, Y, Width and Height are in \"panel units\" whereas they were actual pixel units before. Default Font Size, Text Offsets and Padding are in panel units.\n\nSee Operator Snippets for examples of the Text COMP.\n\nSee Text Formatting Codes\n\nNote: The Text COMP is a replacement for the Field COMP, completely replacing it and adding many new features not previously available.\n\ntextCOMP_Class\n\nThe Layout parameter page controls the size and position of the panel.\n\nThe Panel parameter page controls panel attributes such as display on/off, enable on/off, panel help, and interactions with the cursor.\n\nThe Color parameter page sets the panel's background, border, and disabled colors.\n\nThe Children parameter page controls aspects of the Panel's children alignment, size, and position.\n\nPlease refer to Drag-and-Drop for a full explanation on how Drag and Drop between Panel Components functions.\n\nThe Extensions parameter page sets the component's python extensions.  Please see extensions for more information.\n\nThe Common parameter page sets the component's node viewer and clone relationships.\n\nTouchDesigner Build: Latest\\nwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditor",

The Time Component contains a network of operators that can drive a Timeline, drive animations in Animation COMPs, or be used to drive any custom time-based system. The Time Component's parameters define the speed, range, various options for the time system.\n\nThe Time Component is often used in TouchDesigner to allow a component to have its own timeline / clock, this is called Component Time. It is useful for holding some parts of your system stationary while others are allowed to play forward. A Time Component's location must be in the /local network of a Component for the Time Component to create a Component Time.\n\nTo add Component Time to a component, right-click on the component and select Add Component Time... from the popup menu, this will add the following Time Component /comppath/local/time.\n\nThe Time Component's predefined network is Cloned from Master Component /sys/local/time.  The Time Component's network can be modified if the path in the Clone parameter is removed.\n\ntimeCOMP_Class\n\nThe Extensions parameter page sets the component's python extensions.  Please see extensions for more information.\n\nThe Common parameter page sets the component's node viewer and clone relationships.\n\nExtra Information for the Time COMP can be accessed via an Info CHOP.\n\nTouchDesigner Build: Latest\\nwikieditor2021.100002018.28070before 2018.28070",

      "description": "The USD COMP loads and imports most geometric schemas from a USD file in crate/binary or ASCII file formats with extensions as (.usd), (.usda), (.usdc), and (.usdz). Currently the USD version 0.18.9 is being used in USD COMP. You can drag-drop a USD file into a TouchDesigner network, or import it via the USD File parameter. See also File Types.\n\nThe assets from the USD file are saved into a \".tdc\" file with the same name as the USD file inside the TDImportCache folder, which is created next to your toe file. Assets are read from the \".tdc\" file using Import Select OPs (Import Select TOP / Import Select SOP / Import Select CHOP). Upon reloading a .toe file, the assets can be imported directly from the \".tdc\" cache, and the USD file will not need to be re-imported. However, if there is no existing \".tdc\" (for instance, if the toe file changed computers) then the USD file will be reopened to grab the assets and a new \".tdc\" will be saved out.\n\nTo open a USD file in an USD COMP:\n\n1) Specify a valid file path in the \"USD File\" parameter, including the name of the file with correct .usd extension.\n\n2) This step is varied depending on whether the USD COMP is just created and if any changes in the default values of parameters are required or not. If the file is being loaded for the first time in the network and the default parameter values are accepted then simply press the \"Build Network\" to generate the USD network and import the assets. Note that we recommend toggling the \"Merge Geometry\" for any medium or large files as it can significantly improve performance. Generally, any changes in the parameters above the \"Build Network\" requires the network to be built again.\n\n3) The \"Reload\" button is being used for reloading the internal assets (e.g. meshes, points, etc.) and this is specifically useful if the file has moved to another location and when the .toe file is opened the assets were not found and reloaded properly.\n\n4) The \"Update\" button is used when some changes on USD file are made and we want to merge those changes into the current network without fully rebuilding it.\n\nHere are some examples: https://developer.apple.com/augmented-reality/quick-look/\n\nusdCOMP_Class\n\nThis page includes the animation controls parameters of USD within TouchDesigner.\n\nThe Xform parameter page controls the object component's transform in world space.\n\nThe Pre-Xform parameter page applies a transform to the object component the same way connecting another Object as a parent of this node does. The transform is applied to the left of the Xform page's parameters. In terms of matrix math, if we use the 'multiply on the right' (column vector) convention, the equation would be preXForm * xform * Position.\n\nThe Display parameter page controls the component's material and rendering settings.\n\nThe Extensions parameter page sets the component's python extensions.  Please see extensions for more information.\n\nThe Common parameter page sets the component's node viewer and clone relationships.\n\nExtra Information for the USD COMP can be accessed via an Info CHOP.\n\nTouchDesigner Build: Latest\\nwikieditor2021.100002019.146502018.28070",

Then Parent the Camera to the newly created Null Component, and tell the camera to look at this Component using the Look At parameter. You can direct the attention of the camera by moving the Null Component with the Select state. If you want to see both the camera and the Null Component, enable the Null Component's display flag, and use the Select state in an additional Viewport by clicking one of the icons in the top-right corner of the TouchDesigner window."

      "description": "The USD COMP loads and imports most geometric schemas from a USD file in crate/binary or ASCII file formats with extensions as (.usd), (.usda), (.usdc), and (.usdz). Currently the USD version 0.18.9 is being used in USD COMP. You can drag-drop a USD file into a TouchDesigner network, or import it via the USD File parameter. See also File Types.\n\nThe assets from the USD file are saved into a \".tdc\" file with the same name as the USD file inside the TDImportCache folder, which is created next to your toe file. Assets are read from the \".tdc\" file using Import Select OPs (Import Select TOP / Import Select SOP / Import Select CHOP). Upon reloading a .toe file, the assets can be imported directly from the \".tdc\" cache, and the USD file will not need to be re-imported. However, if there is no existing \".tdc\" (for instance, if the toe file changed computers) then the USD file will be reopened to grab the assets and a new \".tdc\" will be saved out.\n\nTo open a USD file in an USD COMP:\n\n1) Specify a valid file path in the \"USD File\" parameter, including the name of the file with correct .usd extension.\n\n2) This step is varied depending on whether the USD COMP is just created and if any changes in the default values of parameters are required or not. If the file is being loaded for the first time in the network and the default parameter values are accepted then simply press the \"Build Network\" to generate the USD network and import the assets. Note that we recommend toggling the \"Merge Geometry\" for any medium or large files as it can significantly improve performance. Generally, any changes in the parameters above the \"Build Network\" requires the network to be built again.\n\n3) The \"Reload\" button is being used for reloading the internal assets (e.g. meshes, points, etc.) and this is specifically useful if the file has moved to another location and when the .toe file is opened the assets were not found and reloaded properly.\n\n4) The \"Update\" button is used when some changes on USD file are made and we want to merge those changes into the current network without fully rebuilding it.\n\nHere are some examples: https://developer.apple.com/augmented-reality/quick-look/\n\nusdCOMP_Class\n\nThis page includes the animation controls parameters of USD within TouchDesigner.\n\nThe Xform parameter page controls the object component's transform in world space.\n\nThe Pre-Xform parameter page applies a transform to the object component the same way connecting another Object as a parent of this node does. The transform is applied to the left of the Xform page's parameters. In terms of matrix math, if we use the 'multiply on the right' (column vector) convention, the equation would be preXForm * xform * Position.\n\nThe Display parameter page controls the component's material and rendering settings.\n\nThe Extensions parameter page sets the component's python extensions.  Please see extensions for more information.\n\nThe Common parameter page sets the component's node viewer and clone relationships.\n\nExtra Information for the USD COMP can be accessed via an Info CHOP.\n\nTouchDesigner Build: Latest\\nwikieditorwikieditor",

Then Parent the Camera to the newly created Null Component, and tell the camera to look at this Component using the Look At parameter. You can direct the attention of the camera by moving the Null Component with the Select state. If you want to see both the camera and the Null Component, enable the Null Component's display flag, and use the Select state in an additional Viewport by clicking one of the icons in the top-right corner of the TouchDesigner window."

All Window COMPS in your project are listed there and you can test them individually.\n\nA window can be fit to a single monitor, or span several monitors.\n\nAttach an Info CHOP to the Window component - it will show you the window's current location and size, and whether the window is actually open.\n\nwindowCOMP_Class\n\nThe Extensions parameter page sets the component's python extensions.

In the Parameter dialog of the Window component you adjust its settings such as resolution, centering, and which monitor(s) the window will get displayed on.\n\nYou then press F1 to go into Perform Mode and operate/display the panel standalone.\n\nPress Esc over a window to close it and go back to Designer Mode.\n\nYou can create more Window Components, point them to panels or other Operators like TOPs, adjust their parameters and then pulse the parameter Open as Separate Window to see its effect.\n\nUse the Dialog-> Window Placement Dialog which controls which window COMPs get displayed on startup. All Window COMPS in your project are listed there and you can test them individually.\n\nA window can be fit to a single monitor, or span several monitors.\n\nAttach an Info CHOP to the Window component - it will show you the window's current location and size, and whether the window is actually open.\n\nwindowCOMP_Class\n\nThe Extensions parameter page sets the component's python extensions.  Please see extensions for more information.\n\nThe Common parameter page sets the component's node viewer and clone relationships.\n\nExtra Information for the Window COMP can be accessed via an Info CHOP.\n\nTouchDesigner Build: Latest\\nwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditor",
