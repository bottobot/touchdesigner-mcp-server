A powerful Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that brings comprehensive TouchDesigner operator documentation and tutorials directly to your AI coding assistant! üöÄ

I personally use it with VS Code/Codium and the Roo Code Extension alongside my favorite LLMs like Claude Opus and GPT-5. While the server should theoretically work with other applications like Docker or Claude Desktop, I haven't thoroughly tested those integrations yet.

**The Story So Far:** The catalyst for this project was simple ‚Äî A few months ago I decided I wanted an AI tool that could develop visuals in TouchDesigner for me. I've been making some basic things in TD for awhile but it has one of the steepest learning curves of any creative software I've ever used. How nice would it be just to ask an LLM "Please make a 720p, animated in realtime, constantly evolving, reaction diffusion simulation in TouchDesigner." and then just have it spit one out? Super duper nice is the answer in my opinion. 

Like every project I undertake where I know very little, I thought it would be pretty straight forward! LOL! When I started I had no idea just how much time and tokens I would end up sinking into this one. And I still have a ways to go
before I consider it complete with full integration into TouchDesigner itself and very little margin of error.

However as far as querying information about operators and their parameters goes ‚Äî it works pretty darn well! üí™ The major challenge I face with getting any LLM to use this tool effectively for developing networks with real complexity is that the models tend to forget to use the MCP server and fall back on their outdated trained knowledge of much older TouchDesigner versions. If anyone has suggestions on how to overcome this particular wrinkle, I'd absolutely love to hear your feedback!

## How to Use It (My Current Workflow) ‚ö°

Right now, I'm focused on ensuring the server returns useful and accurate Python API information. Here's my workflow: I describe the network I want to create‚Äîfor example, a reaction diffusion visualization‚Äîand then ask the AI to write a Python script that generates the network inside TouchDesigner using the textport. Once that's complete, I get an 'exec' command that lets me copy and paste just one line into the textport, and voil√†‚Äîa network is generated! ‚ú®

**My ultimate dream**, however, is full integration directly into TouchDesigner itself. I experimented with a web server and WebSocket approach, which sort of worked, but since the LLMs I was testing weren't generating correct Python code and kept hallucinating information while not utilizing the MCP server to its fullest potential, I've temporarily shelved this part of the project. Once it's working reliably and generating solid visualizations or networks, then full integration will be the final step! üéØ
